Manipulating the available human resources of a business optimizes the expense of developing products and services, improves work productivity, and brings more value to the business. In the process of creating products and benefits in the enterprise, a network of working relationships is formed among employees in the organization. In this paper, we propose an approach to support decision-making on human resource allocation in an organization based on the human-centric network discovered from the event logs. To be more precise, the knowledge derived from human-centric networks formed through the operation phases of the information systems is used to make resource allocation strategies in the organizations. Using the appropriateness probabilities and social network metrics for allocating human resources, we clarify efficiently allocating resources based on different metrics. The system architecture and the scenarios are also described for planning human resources allocation based on these networks. Furthermore, we use real-life data set for getting experimental verification and proving the proposal. This approach will be a promising solution to support businesses effectively allocating resources in their organizations.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3152778","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9717243","Human-centric network;human resources allocation;business process management;process mining;process-aware information system","Resource management;Organizations;Data mining;Information systems;Standards organizations;Bipartite graph;Task analysis","business data processing;decision making;human resource management;information systems;resource allocation;social networking (online)","experimental verification;human-centric network-based resource allocation approaches;process-aware information systems;efficient allocating human resource;business operations;enterprise;available human resources;work productivity;human resource allocation;resource allocation strategies;organizations;social network metrics;human resources allocation","","1","","42","CCBY","18 Feb 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Feng","Yinchuan Institute of Science and Technology, Yinchuan, China","2022 IEEE 2nd International Conference on Mobile Networks and Wireless Communications (ICMNWC)","7 Feb 2023","2022","","","1","4","With the development of the global network economy, competition in the global market has become increasingly fierce, the scale and number of commercial projects have continued to grow, and the requirements for human resource planning and management have become higher and higher. Traditional human resource management methods are often based on the personal subjective experience of managers, which is easy to make mistakes. Moreover, with the use of database technology and related computer technology in it, the amount of data in enterprises has increased sharply. Finding the information needed by the enterprise in the data information is related to the success or failure of the operation of the enterprise. At this time, the decision tree application based on data mining can analyze and process the data, and provide a basis for the management of human resources scheduling. The purpose of this article is to study the human resource intelligent scheduling algorithm based on the decision tree algorithm, analyze the decision tree algorithm in detail, find the core problem of the decision tree algorithm, integrate human market resources, and solve the key problems in modern human resource management. It provides a reference for the decision tree algorithm in human resource intelligent scheduling. Experiments show that the human resource scheduling based on the decision tree algorithm significantly shortens the cycle project, up to 27.5%. It greatly saves the time spent on human resource scheduling, which meets the expectations of the experiment.","","978-1-6654-9111-2","10.1109/ICMNWC56175.2022.10031690","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10031690","decision tree algorithm;human resource management;scheduling algorithm;data mining","Wireless communication;Economics;Scheduling algorithms;Decision making;Globalization;Scheduling;Planning","data mining;decision trees;globalisation;human resource management;scheduling","computer technology;data mining;database technology;decision tree algorithm;global market;global network economy;human market resources;human resource intelligent scheduling algorithm;human resource management","","","","12","IEEE","7 Feb 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Process execution efficiency can be improved by correctly allocating human resources, which also increases the revenue and satisfaction of clients in organizations. To gain access to these approaches among the resources, banks are trying to streamline their processes. For this reason, it is essential to take into consideration the prerequisites for an accurate view of the sessions. Nevertheless, few works have tended to process mining as it is connected to the banking industry. This work presents a new approach to solving human resource allocation problems in the credit requirement processes that combines process mining, statistical techniques, and the Theory of Constraint (TOC) method. The statistical techniques are used to build a simulation model. Moreover, to obtain more reliable results from the simulation, in this study, four scenarios are designed to simulate reality. By using it, the bottleneck in the process can be identified. At the end, TOC techniques have been used to tackle the identified bottleneck. This study suggests a combination of resources and activity within fewer iterations compared to the literature and proposes an online process to collect documents which is a second stage of the credit requirement process to overcome the existing bottleneck.","","979-8-3503-2062-6","10.1109/IKT57960.2022.10039030","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10039030","Business Process Management;Banking Industry;Metaheuristic Algorithm;Process Mining;Credit Requirement","Industries;Analytical models;System dynamics;Statistical analysis;Banking;System improvement;Reliability theory","bank data processing;computer simulation;data mining;resource allocation;statistical analysis","banking industry;credit requirement process;human resource allocation problems;online process;process execution efficiency;process mining approach;simulation model;statistical techniques;Theory of Constraint method;TOC techniques","","","","19","IEEE","14 Feb 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

From an application perspective, the study of task scheduling mechanisms for data transfer in large cloud computing environments needs to be performed better. Unbalanced scheduling leads to traffic load, energy loss, and hardware control failure. In addition, residents' devices are not considered to reduce power consumption delay. So, the Internet of things (IoT) rules the modern trends of the Internet. The enormous number of things (objects), which are associated with the Internet, produces a large amount of information that needs a ton of exertion and task preparation to make it valuable. To resolve this problem, we propose a dynamic multi-level task scheduling (DMLTS) based on cascade shrink priority (CSP) to allocate the task to optimize the scheduling. With intent, a Tactical Load Balancer (TLB) and The Preemptive Flow Manager (PFM) are responsible for applying a load balancing strategy based on the mixed load balancing algorithm to improve the task allocation better to balance the load to improve the response time. Experimental results have been demonstrated concerning better load balancing, lower power rate, and time consumption rate in both phase and random uniform propagation. Simulated results performance of this process can reduce data processing time and achieve load neutralization.","","978-1-6654-5637-1","10.1109/ICKECS56523.2022.10060053","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10060053","Task Scheduling;Preemptive Flow Manager;Cloud Computing;Allocation;Scheduling;Dynamic Multi-Level Task Scheduling (DMLTS);Cascade Shrink Priority (CSP)","Cloud computing;Processor scheduling;Heuristic algorithms;Dynamic scheduling;Load management;Resource management;Internet of Things","cloud computing;Internet of Things;power consumption;resource allocation;scheduling","application perspective;cloud computing environments;cloud environment;data processing time;data transfer;dynamic multilevel task scheduling;dynamic priority;efficient task scheduling;emerging field process;energy loss;enormous number;enormous task;hardware control failure;load balancing strategy;load neutralization;lower power rate;mixed load balancing algorithm;optimized technique;power consumption delay;residents;simulated results performance;Tactical Load Balancer;task allocation;task scheduling mechanisms;things;time consumption rate;traffic load;unbalanced scheduling","","","","21","IEEE","17 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The main three techniques while applying process mining to event logs are process discovery, process enhancement and conformance checking. Among many different applications that process mining can be applied to, in this paper, process mining is used to discover the model from event logs generated from simulations of the ""Handle Complaint Process"" Workflow net based on a p-time Petri net model with hybrid resources. This net discovered with process mining must be similar to the original one due event logs used to generate it are created from the simulation. There is no doubt that process mining has become increasingly useful for the future of Workflow nets especially when it is followed by simulation. Process mining can discover processes from event logs, find deviations and produce a better workflow while simulation can test new scenarios and hypotheses. With both working together product owners can reach a pretty good process excellence. The ""Handle Complaint Process"" Workflow net based on a p-time Petri net model with hybrid resources tries to solve the real time scheduling problem of Workflow Management Systems. The approach made in this work in particular, utilizes discrete + continuous resources and real time to decide when to fire a transition in the Workflow net. To generate the event logs from the simulation of the Workflow net, some functions were added in order to capture the identification number of each token, the path made by it, as well as the timestamp in the moment the transition was fired and the person or system responsible for the activity. This Workflow net was simulated using CPN Tools. The logs generated from the simulation were converted using the ProM Import tool and the process mining discovery technique was applied using ProM. The use of event logs of a business process model is a way to detect deviations from the expected behavior. Based on these deviations, the process can be changed in order to achieve excellence. The logs from the p-net model with hybrid resources tries to simulate, in a better way, the human behavior. As the model generated from the logs is similar to the original one, the conversion is correct. As a future work proposal, we will compare a real event log with the results achieved with this work to see the efficiency in simulating a process model with hybrid resources.","","978-1-6654-1250-6","10.1109/SIEDS52267.2021.9483768","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9483768","component;formatting;style;styling;insert","Visualization;Petri nets;PROM;Tools;Real-time systems;Hybrid power systems;Proposals","business data processing;data mining;Petri nets;workflow management software","p-time Petri net model;hybrid resources;event logs;process mining discovery technique;business process model;handle complaint process workflow net;CPN tools;ProM import tool;p-net model","","","","40","IEEE","16 Jul 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

These event data can be analyzed through process mining techniques. For traditional process mining techniques, one has to associate each event with exactly one object, e.g., the company’s customer. Events related to one object form an event sequence called a case. A case describes an end-to-end run through a process. The cases contained in event data can be used to discover a process model, detect frequent bottlenecks, or learn predictive models. However, events encountered in real-life information systems, e.g., ERP systems, can often be associated with multiple objects. The traditional sequential case concept falls short of these so-called object-centric event data since these data exhibit a graph structure. One might force object-centric event data into the traditional case concept by flattening it. However, flattening manipulates the data and removes information. Therefore, a concept analogous to the case concept of traditional event logs is necessary to enable the application of different process mining tasks on object-centric event data. In this paper, we introduce the case concept for object-centric process mining: process executions. These are graph-based generalizations of cases as considered in traditional process mining. Furthermore, we provide techniques to extract process executions. Based on these executions, we determine equivalent process behavior with respect to an attribute using graph isomorphism. Equivalent process executions with respect to the event’s activity are object-centric variants, i.e., a generalization of variants in traditional process mining. We provide a visualization technique for object-centric variants. The contribution’s scalability and efficiency are extensively evaluated. Furthermore, we provide a case study showing the most frequent object-centric variants of a real-life event log. Our contributions might be used as a basis to adapt traditional process mining techniques by researchers and to generate initial control-flow insights into object-centric event logs by practitioners.","","979-8-3503-9714-7","10.1109/ICPM57379.2022.9980730","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9980730","Object-centric process mining;variants","Scalability;Force;Process control;Predictive models;Data models;Behavioral sciences;Data mining","business data processing;data mining;enterprise resource planning;graph theory;information systems;learning (artificial intelligence)","ERP systems;event logs;event sequence;frequent object-centric variants;graph isomorphism;object-centric event data;object-centric event logs;object-centric process mining;process executions;process mining techniques;real-life event","","","","27","IEEE","14 Dec 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, for the relatively limited resources and capabilities of the edge nodes, such as computing resource and storage resource, it is hard to highly and comprehensively satisfy the high real-time requirements of cable online monitoring tasks. To solve this problem, effectively dynamic task allocation is needed on the basis of efficient utilization and optimization of resource and capabilities of the edge nodes. In this article, a task allocation mechanism for cable real-time online monitoring business based on edge computing is proposed. First, considering the linear distribution characteristics of the cable, the statuses of edge nodes, the processing overhead of tasks, and the scheduling strategy of delay-sensitive tasks, we establish a task allocation model based on edge computing. Second, a task allocation strategy based on improved discrete particle swarm optimization is proposed. In our strategy, we focus on the task queuing problem in edge nodes and the optimized task allocation problem among edge nodes.

This makes cloud data centres unable to meet the demands of IoT applications. Due to resource constraints and the massive connectivity of IoT devices, efficient task (incoming request) allocation is critical for service providers. We create a novel processing power-based task scheduling technique that employs a broker manager to distribute tasks and the process strategy across multiple devices. This is important in cloud technology because it enables organisations to effectively scale their processes. We use multithreading to parallelize processes and evaluate the performance of the proposed model using existing task allocation algorithms (i) round-robin, (ii) weighted round-robin, (iii) random allocation, (iv) genetic algorithm, and (v) dynamic algorithm. Our results show that when there are few tasks and one cluster has more processing capacity than the others, a weighted round-robin algorithm works well. The effectiveness of allocating based on weight shows no improvement in task completion time as task size increases.

This helps a business to stay competitive. A process model may be redesigned by a rearrangement of various activities as per best practices to satisfy predefined business rules and constraints for a specific objective. This objective is stated in terms of functional goals like desired or acceptable process behavior, and nonfunctional goals such as cost, time, quality of service, and flexibility. Thus, many potential improvement possibilities that emerge through restructuring can be explored. When many such alternatives exist, there is a need for a formal methodology for evaluating these designs on various metrics to gain a deeper understanding of the tradeoffs involved. In this article, we describe a novel, formal methodology for optimizing the cost-benefit considerations within a space of possible redesigns to develop a cost vs. time efficient frontier.

This may result in an increase in the execution cost, flexibility restrictions, and a negative impact on the Quality of Service. In order to overcome these drawbacks, we introduce the Vienna Platform for Elastic Processes on Containers (ViePEP-C). ViePEP-C is an elastic BPMS that uses containers instead of VMs for the execution of business process activities on cloud resources, leading to a more fine-grained execution environment. To achieve this, ViePEP-C offers cloud controller, monitoring and business process execution functionalities and provides a platform for different resource and task scheduling algorithms. To evaluate the benefits of ViePEP-C, we further present a resource and task scheduling algorithm and show that, by using containers as execution environment, the execution cost can be decreased by over 20 percent (compared to a state-of-the-art VM-based scheduling algorithm) while considering a high service level.","2168-7161","","10.1109/TCC.2019.2912613","Austrian Research Promotion Agency(grant numbers:854187); FFG(grant numbers:866270); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8695740","Cloud computing;containers;elastic processes;business process management","Containers;Cloud computing;Manufacturing processes;Business process management","business data processing;cloud computing;resource allocation;scheduling;virtual machines","business process management systems;fluctuating demand;computational resources;cloud resources;coarse-grained allocation;elastic BPMS;fine-grained execution environment;business process execution functionalities;task scheduling algorithm;VM-based scheduling algorithm;Vienna platform;ViePEP-C;container-based elastic process platform","","7","","56","IEEE","23 Apr 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The edge–cloud computing infrastructure allows a large amount of data to be processed on nearby edge nodes and then only the extracted and encrypted key features are transmitted to the data center. This offers the potential to achieve an end–edge–cloud-based big data intelligence for IoE in a typical two-stage data processing scheme, while satisfying a data security constraint.

A presorting scheme based on Johnson’s rule is developed and applied to preprocess the two-stage tasks on multiple executors, and a DRL mechanism is developed to minimize the overall makespan based on a newly designed instant reward that takes into account the maximal utilization of each executor in edge-enabled two-stage scheduling.

In the early days, experts paid major attention to calculating business similarity according to corresponding process models. However, models only express ideal behavior of business processes without any undesired or unexpected business routines. In order to fully model business behavior, some researchers use system logs in similarity measuring. But previous system-logs-based similarity measurements have limitations on: (1) satisfaction of algorithm properties, (2) distribution of similarity values, and (3) complexity of algorithm. In this article, we take the advantages of token logs in process behavioral similarity measuring. Firstly, the Token Log Profile, modeled with a relation matrix, is defined as an abstraction of the initial token logs. Then, similarity between business processes is calculated based on their Token Log Profiles according to the proposed algorithm. Besides, we extend the properties that similarity algorithms should satisfy for evaluating the proposed algorithm. The experimental and analytical results show that our algorithm achieves very promising accuracy and efficiency while satisfying all the proposed properties compared with state-of-the-art algorithms.","1939-1374","","10.1109/TSC.2021.3104898","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61802167,61802095); Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province(grant numbers:BK20201250); Open Foundation of State key Laboratory of Networking; Switching Technology Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications(grant numbers:SKLNST-2019-2-15); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9514474","Business process management;process similarity;process model;token log;token log profile;event log","Business;Task analysis;Companies;Process modeling;Process control;Analytical models;Software algorithms","business data processing;matrix algebra;optimisation","algorithm properties;business behavior;business process behavioral similarity measurement;business similarity calculation;corresponding process models;ideal behavior;initial token logs;previous system-logs-based similarity measurements;relation matrix;similarity values;token log profile;undesired business routines;unexpected business routines","","","","38","IEEE","16 Aug 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To address these requirements, businesses have incorporated a workflow management system that helps in automating the business tasks and increasing the overall efficiency. With this great advancement in workflows, comes a major challenge: the workflows hinder the change of workflow logic flexibly. This challenge faces difficulties in meeting demands from intensifying market competition. To solve the above issues, we have developed a flexible workflow engine using the directed graph theory concepts in this project. Using this approach, the changeable business processes can be modelled dynamically without the need for the redefinition of the model. Additionally, we have also introduced load balancing applications in the workflow model to balance the work equally among all tasks for ensuring non-skewed distribution of the work. This application provides sequential and parallel processing of tasks in the workflow. The tool also takes input in the form of text file which is in structured English format with annotations and this is converted into workflow engine automatically. We have also incorporated a feature in the workflow to predict the time taken to execute the workflow engine for a total number of users given and to predict the total number of users that can be executed in a given time.","","978-1-6654-2577-3","10.1109/ICONAT53423.2022.9725954","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9725954","workflow;flexible;load index;load balancing;dynamic;scalable;graphs;tasks;organization;business process;path;query;priority;text-to-workflow","Annotations;Directed graphs;Parallel processing;Load management;Task analysis;Engines;Workflow management software","business data processing;business process re-engineering;directed graphs;graph theory;organisational aspects;resource allocation;workflow management software","parallel processing;flexible workflow engine;global competition;market demands;workflow management system;business tasks;workflow logic;market competition;changeable business processes;load balancing applications;workflow model","","","","5","IEEE","10 Mar 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Compared to cloud computing, fog computing focuses on ubiquitous connected heterogeneous devices and addresses the transmission latency by placing the fog nodes at the network edge. Concerning the limited resources of fog nodes enable the computationally intensive tasks to offload on the cloud resources. Scheduling of deadline-constrained workflows with minimum execution cost is challenging due to complex and uncertain computation offloading problems. Therefore, an intelligent fuzzy scheduler is designed to offload tasks characterized with uncertain parameters to the appropriate resources. A new salp swarm algorithm has been exploited to learn and optimize fuzzy task-resource allocation rules. In addition to this, to overcome the shortcomings of the salp swarm algorithm, it is employed with one of the best opposition methods named: Fitness-based quasi-reflection method. The inclusion of the opposition method enhances the proposed ISSS-FQR (Intelligent salp swarm scheduler with the fitness-based quasi-reflection method) approach and improves the learning process. Simulation studies on the benchmark workflows are carried out to demonstrate the efficacy of ISSS-FQR. ISSS-FQR has been compared with the classical algorithms, including chemical reaction optimization and ant colony optimization algorithms for workflow scheduling problems (CR-AC), Cost-Makespan aware scheduling (Deadline-based CMaS), and Directional and non-local convergent particle swarm optimization (DNCPSO). From the analyzed result, ISSS-FQR outperforms the rest of the classical algorithms, which proves the effectiveness of ISSS-FQR. Note to Practitioners—This paper provides a novel method called ISSS-FQR for minimizing the cost of execution of IoT applications while satisfying the deadline constraint. An intelligent fuzzy scheduler is designed to offload tasks characterized with uncertain parameters to the appropriate resources. The ISSS-FQR combines the Salp Swarm Algorithm and the OBL method named FQR to learn the task-resource allocation rules. It is compared with three state-of-the-art algorithms called CR-AC, Deadline-based CMaS, and DNCPSO. From the analyzed result, it has been observed that ISSS-FQR outperforms the previous algorithms.","1558-3783","","10.1109/TASE.2022.3170549","Indian Institute of Technology (Indian School of Mines), Dhanbad, Government of India; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9769700","Cloud computing;fog computing;fuzzy swarm schedular;makespan;salp swarm algorithm;fitness based quasi-reflection;ISSS-FQR;workflow scheduling","Task analysis;Cloud computing;Costs;Processor scheduling;Scheduling;Internet of Things;Edge computing","ant colony optimisation;cloud computing;computer centres;Internet of Things;learning (artificial intelligence);mobile computing;optimisation;particle swarm optimisation;resource allocation;scheduling;search problems","addresses;ant colony optimization algorithms;appropriate resources;cloud computing;cloud data centers;cloud resources;complex computation offloading problems;computationally intensive tasks;Cost-Makespan aware scheduling;Deadline-based CMaS;deadline-constrained workflows;Fitness based quasireflection method;fog computing;fog nodes;fuzzy task-resource allocation rules;hybrid cloud-fog environment;intelligent devices;intelligent fuzzy scheduler;Intelligent salp swarm scheduler with the fitness-based quasireflection method;IoT applications;ISSS-FQR;opposition method;salp swarm algorithm;ubiquitous connected heterogeneous devices;uncertain computation offloading problems;uncertain parameters;workflow scheduling problems","","1","","37","IEEE","5 May 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, due to the limited capacity of edge servers (ESs) and the dynamic computing requirements, the system needs to dynamically update the task allocation policy according to real-time system states. Service migration is essential to ensure service continuity when implementing dynamic task allocation. Therefore, this article investigates the long-term dynamic task allocation and service migration (DTASM) problem in edge-cloud IoT systems where users’ computing requirements and mobility change over time. The DTASM problem is formulated to achieve the long-term performance of minimizing the load forwarded to the cloud while fulfilling the seamless migration constraint and the latency constraint at each time of implementing the DTASM decision. First, the DTASM problem is divided into two subproblems: 1) the user selection problem on each ES and 2) the system task allocation problem. Then, the DTASM problem is formulated as a Markov decision process (MDP) and an approach based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is proposed. To tackle the challenge of vast discrete action spaces for DTASM task allocation in the system with a mass of IoT users, a training architecture based on the twin-delayed deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) is employed. Meanwhile, each action is divided into a differentiable action for policy training and one mapped action for implementation in the IoT system. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed DRL-based approach obtains the long-term optimal system performance compared to other benchmarks while satisfying seamless service migration.","2327-4662","","10.1109/JIOT.2022.3164441","Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(grant numbers:2020ZDPY0304); Chinese Government Scholarship awarded by China Scholarship Council(grant numbers:202006420096); European Union’s Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Program under the MonB5G Project(grant numbers:871780); Academy of Finland 6Genesis Project(grant numbers:318927); IDEA-MILL(grant numbers:335936); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9748866","Deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG);deep reinforcement learning (DRL);dynamic task allocation;edge computing (EC);Internet of Things;seamless service migration","Task analysis;Resource management;Internet of Things;Quality of service;Dynamic scheduling;Heuristic algorithms;Servers","cloud computing;Internet of Things;learning (artificial intelligence);Markov processes;mobile communication;optimisation;resource allocation","seamless service migration;long-term optimal system performance;twin-delayed deep deterministic policy gradient;IoT users;DTASM task allocation;system task allocation problem;user selection problem;DTASM decision;seamless migration constraint;DTASM problem;service migration problem;long-term dynamic task allocation;service continuity;real-time system states;task allocation policy;dynamic computing requirements;edge servers;performance-sensitive IoT applications;diverse resource-sensitive;network edge;edge computing;deep reinforcement learning;edge-cloud IoT system","","2","","45","IEEE","4 Apr 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
"Asteroid Mineral Allocation Algorithm for Global Equity","P. Ma","Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, China","2022 International Conference on Information Technology, Communication Ecosystem and Management (ITCEM)","3 Apr 2023","2022","","","46","50","The exploration of space and the struggle for equity are eternal human pursuits. With the vision that humans will be able to mine on asteroids in the near future, it is significant to propose an asteroid mineral allocation strategy that promotes equitable global development. Firstly, the global equity model is proposed to quantify the global equity through 10 indicators of development. The weights of these indicators are calculated by the Entropy Weight Method (EWM). Then, the comprehensive development index of each country is calculated by TOPSIS. By using the Thiel index to evaluate the inequity among countries' comprehensive development index, equity index will be defined. Based on the multiple resource allocation algorithm Dominant Resource Fairness, the DRF algorithm applicable to asteroid mineral resource allocation is proposed by adding the process of classifying countries and resources and assigning different weights to them. In order to verify whether the proposed allocation strategy is effective in improving global equity, a simulation system will be created. By comparing with random allocation, unrestricted allocation and max-min fairness, weighted DRF algorithm is proved to be significantly better than random allocation and unrestricted allocation, and achieves almost the same effect as max-min fairness while reducing the restriction on resource allocation to developed countries. Therefore weighted DRF can significantly improve global equity by proper allocation of asteroid mineral. According to the results simulation system, after 50 years of asteroid mineral resource allocation, the global equity index was able to achieve a decrease in the Thiel index from 0.3 to 0.1.","","978-1-6654-6301-0","10.1109/ITCEM57303.2022.00017","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10086427","Global Equity;Entropy Weight;TOPSIS;Asteroid Mining;Forecasting","Heuristic algorithms;Simulation;Asteroids;Minimax techniques;Classification algorithms;Space exploration;Resource management","asteroids;entropy;minimax techniques;mining industry;resource allocation;TOPSIS","asteroid mineral resource allocation;comprehensive development index;entropy weight method;equitable global development;eternal human pursuits;EWM;global equity index;max-min fairness;multiple resource allocation algorithm dominant resource fairness;random allocation;Thiel index;TOPSIS;weighted DRF algorithm","","","","11","IEEE","3 Apr 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Hence, Internet of Things (IoT) dominates the current trends in the Internet. The large number of things (things) associated with the Internet creates a large amount of information that requires a lot of effort and work preparation to make it valuable.

Map reduction is a programming model for simultaneous processing and generation of massive amounts of data. We examine Map Reduce employing Naive Bayes, J48, and Random Forest algorithms with a variety of processing features for efficient mining that also saves energy. The Naive Bayes algorithm generates more energy and fewer maps. Priority-based scheduling is a task that allocates schedules based on the jobs’ requirements and utilization. As a result of decreasing the maps, the system’s workload is reduced, and energy efficiency is improved.

Multi-processor heterogeneous system has been widely used for handling parallel workflow applications to advance the performance of system, in which efficient workflow scheduling and the choice of frequency for each task play key roles. However, most scheduling algorithms just focus on an optimal solution for every single task and may exclude optimal task priority sequence at the task sorting phase. Therefore, this paper proposes a Predictive Energy Consumption Scheduling (PECS) algorithm to match the frequency for each task. Firstly, the alterable time space is introduced to decompose the deadline of the whole workflow application into each task. Secondly, as the basis of allocation, Predictive Energy Consumption Matrix (ECM) is defined to predict the impact of current task allocation on the energy consumption of subsequent tasks. Thirdly, the processor with the lowest predicted energy consumption is matched for each task to form a preliminary scheduling scheme with the constraint of time. Finally, all tasks in the same priority level of a processor are swapped in order, then a scheduling strategy is formed to minimize energy consumption. Experimental results reveal that our proposed algorithm can reduce energy 48.28% and 13.33% averagely compared with other two state of the art algorithms.","2473-2400","","10.1109/TGCN.2021.3131323","Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62172349,62076214,62032020,61902336); Natural Science Foundation of Hunan Province(grant numbers:2019JJ50592); Hunan Science and Technology Planning Project(grant numbers:2019RS3019); Hunan Provincial Natural Science Foundation of China for Distinguished Young Scholars(grant numbers:2018JJ1025); Excellent Youth Research Foundation of Hunan Provincial Educational Department, China(grant numbers:20B553); project of The State Key Laboratory of Computer Science(grant numbers:SYSKF2101); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9628181","Computer network management;multitasking;scheduling;parallel processing;directed graphs","Task analysis;Energy consumption;Scheduling;Optimal scheduling;Costs;Resource management;Job shop scheduling","energy consumption;Internet of Things;multiprocessing systems;parallel algorithms;power aware computing;processor scheduling;workflow management software","multiprocessor heterogeneous system;workflow scheduling;scheduling algorithms;optimal task priority sequence;task sorting;task allocation;predictive energy consumption matrix;predictive energy consumption scheduling algorithm;Industrial Internet of Things;I-IoT;computing efficiency;parallel workflow application handling;PECS algorithm;workflow application deadline decomposition;ECM;processor priority level;energy consumption minimization","","5","","29","IEEE","30 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Most existing works focus on mitigating interference in D2D communication only in physical space. However, the effect of user content preference on interference in social space is ignored. In this article, a satisfied matching-embedded Social Internet of Things (IoT) is proposed for content preference-aware resource allocation (SIoT-RA). The Social IoT architecture is explored for user social characteristic analysis scenarios to ensure credible data management. Specifically, the user’s content preference characteristics are modeled as the probability of selecting similar content in the social IoT by employing the Dirichlet process. A satisfied matching-based model is proposed and embedded into the architecture as the core algorithm to achieve content preference-aware resource allocation. This design not only helps to reduce interference from the perspective of social space but also realizes maximized and satisfactory resource allocation performance by a matching algorithm that can quantify satisfaction as perceived utility. Extensive simulation results demonstrate the significant performance gains and high cost effectiveness of the proposed core algorithm of SIoT-RA in terms of the weighted sum data rate and users matching satisfaction.","2327-4662","","10.1109/JIOT.2021.3113914","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61901067,61901011,61701125); Chongqing Municipal Natural Science Foundation(grant numbers:cstc2020jcyj-msxmX0339); Science and Technology Research Program of Chongqing Municipal Education Commission(grant numbers:KJQN201900824,KJQN202000811); Chongqing Technology and Business University Foundation(grant numbers:1952002,1956011); National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2020YFB1807801); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9542946","Content preference;device-to-device (D2D) communication;matching algorithm;resource allocation;satisfaction;Social IoT","Resource management;Device-to-device communication;Internet of Things;Interference;Sensors;Quality of service;Games","cellular radio;human computer interaction;Internet of Things;mobile computing;probability;resource allocation","content preference-aware resource allocation;D2D underlaying cellular networks;diverse social content access;device-to-device communication;cellular spectrum resources;user content preference;social space;social IoT architecture;user social characteristic analysis scenarios;similar content;satisfied matching-based model;satisfactory resource allocation performance;satisfied matching-embedded social Internet of Things","","","","33","IEEE","21 Sep 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Without optimized scheduling, desired quality of service cannot be achieved. With effective scheduling of map-reduce sub-tasks other parameters of interest like cost, energy consumption and resource usage can be optimized as well. It is obvious that task scheduling optimization on cloud attracted a lot of researchers. Many heuristics, meta-heuristic and their hybridizations were used for scheduling the multiple tasks to available and limited resources of cloud. Use of metaheuristic algorithms in map-reduce task scheduling on cloud showed better results than only heuristic algorithms. Researchers were well realized that by combining the useful features of two or more algorithms, best scheduling solutions can be achieved. Different available hybrid algorithms are reviewed in this study.

To deal with such problems, applying data pricing strategies in task offloading to schedule traffic data is perceived as a promising solution for Internet service providers (ISPs). However, the traditional application-oriented data pricing strategies do not consider user satisfaction of the task executing process, resulting in lower ISP profit. In this paper, a novel scheme named App-set Usage Patterns-Aware task offloading scheme (AUPA) is proposed to alleviate the tension between traffic data supply and user satisfaction. We mine the sequential patterns in frequent application sets to extract temporal association rules. Then these association rules are used to design a smart data pricing strategy to guide the task offloading decision. Finally, we formulate the ISP’s profit maximization problem as a nonlinear programming (NLP) problem based on partial offloading, and we simulate the scheduling processuse using the Stackelberg game model. The performance of our solution is evaluated in terms of ISP’s profit, consumers’ surplus, capacity utilization, and traffic efficiency. The results show that our scheme significantly improves the ISP’s profit by about 20% while ensuring capacity constraints compared with other baseline schemes.","1938-1883","978-1-5386-8347-7","10.1109/ICC45855.2022.9838928","National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9838928","task offloading;multi-access edge computing;data pricing;sequential pattern mining","Schedules;Multi-access edge computing;Processor scheduling;Conferences;Web and internet services;Pricing;Games","cloud computing;data mining;game theory;Internet;mobile computing;nonlinear programming;optimisation;pricing;profitability;resource allocation;scheduling;smart phones;telecommunication traffic","user satisfaction;frequent application sets;temporal association rules;smart data pricing strategy;task offloading decision;ISP's profit maximization problem;nonlinear programming problem;partial offloading;scheduling processuse;traffic efficiency;traffic data scheduling;frequently task offloading;Multiaccess Edge Computing system;network resources;serious network congestion problems;Internet service providers;ISPs;traditional application-oriented data pricing strategies;task executing process;lower ISP profit;App-set Usage Patterns-Aware task offloading scheme;traffic data supply","","","","24","IEEE","11 Aug 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this article, we question when formal planning is effective, when it is counterproductive, and which planning approach (strategic or tactical) is more effective for various project risk levels and performance dimensions (efficiency and effectiveness). Results from analyzing 2002 projects suggest that strategic planning has a higher value than tactical planning. Furthermore, tactical planning has a negative impact on project efficiency in low-risk projects as it increases project duration and cost but adds little value. In practice, in low-risk projects, managers may limit their focus on counterproductive tactical practices, such as risk, and procurement planning, and focus instead on long-term strategic planning, such as human resources planning.

Due to the large number of container instances running in the platform, complex dependency relationship, fast version iteration and other characteristics, the update of business can often cause the change of the whole cloud resource environment, which triggers the repetitive scheduling problem of related tasks and affects stability of the business. In this paper, we propose a self-adapting task scheduling algorithm (ADATSA) using learning automata to solve these problems. Firstly, we design a learning automata model and objective function for the system on task scheduling problem. Then, we realize an effective reward-penalty mechanism for scheduling actions in combination with the idle state of resources and the running state of tasks in the current environment. Meanwhile, the environment is modeled by cluster, node and task, and the probability of action selected is optimized by scheduling execution, thus enhancing the adaptability to the cloud environment of the scheduling and accelerating convergence. Finally, we construct a framework of task load monitoring with buffer queue to achieve dynamic scheduling based on priority. The experimental part verifies the effectiveness of proposed algorithm with different angles such as resource imbalance degree, resource residual degree and QoS. Compared with other learning automata scheduling models such as LAEAS, non-automata technology based algorithms such as PSOS and K8S scheduling engine, ADATSA shows the better performance of environment adaptability, resource optimization efficiency and QoS in dynamic scheduling.

Business intelligence provides companies with functions such as collecting, storing, accessing, and analyzing company data. In the traditional business model, most companies use human resources to track these large amounts of data and information. And business intelligence provides an automated data processing method that significantly improves efficiency. During a customer relationship management service system, a large amount of data will be generated and stored. With this natural data advantage, data analysis has more possibilities in customer relationship management service systems. Based on the business intelligence system, this paper analyzes the data of the customer system. It puts forward the K-means clustering method to analyze the customer quality, the fuzzy set clustering algorithm to examine whether the customer is active.

It allows users to access a catalog of standardized services and respond to their business needs flexibly and adaptively, in the event of unforeseen demands, paying solely for the consumption they have made. Task scheduling problem is considered one of the most critical cloud computing challenges. The problem refers to how to reasonably order and allocate the applications tasks provided by the users to be executed on virtual machines. Furthermore, the quality of scheduling performance has a direct effect on customer satisfaction. The task scheduling problem in cloud computing must be more accurately described in order to improve scheduling performance. In this paper, a multi-objective task scheduling algorithm is proposed based on the decision tree in a heterogenous environment. We introduce a new Task Scheduling-Decision Tree (TS-DT) algorithm for allocating and executing an application’s task. To evaluate the performance of the proposed TS-DT algorithm, a comparative study was conducted among the existing algorithms; Heterogeneous Earliest Finish Time (HEFT), Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution that incorporates the Entropy Weight Method (TOPSIS-EWM), and combining Q-Learning with the Heterogeneous Earliest Finish Time (QL-HEFT). Our results show that the proposed TS-DT algorithm outperforms the existing HEFT, TOPSIS-EWM, and QL-HEFT algorithms by reducing makespan by 5.21%, 2.54%, and 3.32%, respectively, improving resource utilization by 4.69%, 6.81%, and 8.27%, respectively, and improving load balancing by 33.36%, 19.69%, and 59.06%, respectively in average.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3163273","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9745131","Cloud computing;task scheduling;data dependency;decision tree;makespan;resource utilization;load balancing;energy consumption","Task analysis;Heuristic algorithms;Cloud computing;Scheduling;Load management;Decision trees;Resource management","cloud computing;customer satisfaction;decision trees;entropy;processor scheduling;resource allocation;scheduling;virtual machines","Cloud environment;task scheduling problem;critical cloud computing challenges;applications tasks;scheduling performance;multiobjective task scheduling algorithm;Task Scheduling-Decision Tree algorithm;application;TS-DT algorithm;Heterogeneous Earliest Finish Time;QL-HEFT algorithms","","6","","45","CCBY","30 Mar 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This is mainly because ground-truth process models are usually unknown. To attack this problem, we pay a closer look to several concepts and implicit assumptions in the log completeness estimation problem and characterize it as a special case of the species estimation problem in the field of statistics. Although species estimation is still an open problem, a number of statistic models and techniques with approximate solutions have been available. To investigate the relevance of these methods for event log completeness estimation, we have designed and conducted a wide scope of empirical study and quantitative experiments on both real-world and synthesized event logs to compare the performance of these methods.

The initial process deals with capturing the meal figures from all the customer airlines and distributing the information to the kitchen staff for meal preparation. The study evaluates the processes involved in the data collection phase and relates them to efficiency and productivity and as well as identifies the issues faced by the staff. It is evident that even though technology is used in the data collection phase; the effectiveness is not visible as human intervention is still necessary to collect, consolidate and distribute the information. Multiple sources of information are also another contributing factor that limits efficiency. Given that the means of communication are through emails, phone calls and, text messages; constant checking and verification is required which results in unnecessary time consumption and is prone to human error. This further delays in communicating the information to the ground staff thus limiting efficiency and affecting timely preparation of meals and adjusting to amendments. A software solution is proposed that will be able to handle the current data collection and distribution phase. The software can be used by the organization and the customer airlines as a standard means for communicating meal figures.

Forecasting models learn by minimizing a loss function that stands as a proxy for task-specific costs (e.g., trading, scheduling) without considering the downstream optimization, which in practice creates a performance bottleneck and obscures the impact of data on decisions. This work proposes a single data-driven module that leverages the structure of the optimization component and directly learns a policy conditioned on explanatory data. For this purpose, we describe an algorithm to train ensembles of decision trees by directly minimizing task-specific costs, and prescribe decisions via a weighted Sample Average Approximation of the original problem. We then develop a generic framework to assess the impact of explanatory data on prescriptive performance. To illustrate the efficacy of the proposed modeling approach, we consider two case studies related to trading renewable energy. First, we examine trading in a day-ahead market and propose strategies that balance optimal trading decisions and predictive accuracy. Next, we append a storage device and co-optimize the day-ahead offers and the operational policy, based on a tractable approximation using the linear decision rule approach. The empirical results demonstrate improved prescriptive performance compared to solutions derived under the standard stochastic optimization framework. Further, we provide valuable insights on how explanatory data impact optimization performance and how this impact evolves under different market designs.","1558-0679","","10.1109/TPWRS.2022.3152667","ADEME’s; Investissement d’Avenir; ERA-Net SES RegSys Program(grant numbers:646039); Smart4RES Project(grant numbers:864337); Horizon 2020 Framework Program; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9716858","Data-driven optimization;decision trees;energy forecasting;energy storage system;energy trading;linear decision rules;prescriptive analytics","Forecasting;Optimization;Predictive models;Renewable energy sources;Energy storage systems;Uncertainty;Decision trees","decision trees;learning (artificial intelligence);optimisation;power markets;power system planning;stochastic processes;stochastic programming","downstream optimization;single data-driven module;optimization component;decision trees;task-specific costs;prescribe decisions;weighted Sample Average Approximation;prescriptive performance;trading renewable energy;day-ahead market;balance optimal trading decisions;storage device;day-ahead offers;linear decision rule approach;standard stochastic optimization framework;explanatory data impact optimization performance;prescriptive trees;integrated forecasting;deriving decisions;sequential process;forecasting models;loss function","","6","","44","IEEE","18 Feb 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, this one-sided consideration of the assignment of tasks not only fails to enable workers to perform the appropriate tasks to the best of their ability, but also the number of successful tasks. This becomes even more difficult when a large number of complex tasks are distributed across the globe. The goal of this study is to focus on tasks and the assignment of global workers: to maximize the number of tasks successfully assigned, and to maximize the effort of the workers to complete the appropriate tasks. Then the task assignment process is abstracted into a weighted bipartite graph matching model, which is solved by an improved KM algorithm. Finally, experiments are carried out on real data sets, and the results show that, compared with the previous methods, the method proposed in this paper has achieved good results in increasing the number of successful assignments, improving work efficiency and reducing cost.","","978-1-6654-8541-8","10.1109/ISAIAM55748.2022.00021","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10113254","crowdsourcing platforms;weighted bipartite graph matching model;KM algorithm","Crowdsourcing;Costs;Media;Knowledge management;Bipartite graph;Task analysis;Artificial intelligence","artificial intelligence;business data processing;crowdsourcing;graph theory;optimisation;personnel","artificial intelligence;crowdsourcing;global workers;KM algorithm;task assignment;weighted bipartite graph matching","","","","7","IEEE","5 May 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In order to achieve the goal of minimizing the system average latency time of task processing, based on the power grid dispatching cloud architecture, a delay optimization method based on SDN edge-cloud collaborative computing is proposed. The goal is to minimize the system average delay of task processing. Introduce continuously variable edge and cloud and task distribution coefficients. The delay optimization problem is transformed into the task allocation coefficient optimization problem. And finally get the task allocation optimization strategy based on the model calculation. The experimental results show that when the edge node tasks are reasonably loaded into the cloud center for processing, the system delay of the business can be effectively reduced. Compared with the previous methods, the edge-cloud collaborative computing method proposed in this paper reduces the system delay and utilizes the control mechanism of SDN that can coordinate cloud computing and edge computing.

Such process models include quality-gate models, Scrum, and the water-Scrum-fall-model. The most suitable process model must be chosen to ensure efficient and successful development. However, this is not an easy task, as a direct assignment of a project to a specific process model is not always possible. A potential solution for this issue lies in process mining. Process mining systematically analyses processes based on event logs. These can be used to analyse previous projects within an organisation. A model is created through the determined data of previous projects. This model selects an appropriate process model for project management based on a new project's planned data or context factors. An example is the required team size, which influences the selection of an appropriate model. This allows companies to select a process model based on their experiences and data.","","978-1-6654-1100-4","10.1109/E-TEMS53558.2022.9944415","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9944415","process mining;data mining;process model;process management;project management;agile","Smart cities;Engineering management;Project management;Europe;Companies;Data models;Data mining","data mining;project management;smart cities","agile process models;highly integrated technologies;hybrid process models;networked technologies;process mining;project management approaches;quality-gate models;smart cities;traditional process models;water-Scrum-fall-model","","","","17","IEEE","22 Nov 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In a practical disassembly process, one may face a disassembly operation failure risk due to the difficulty of knowing EOL products’ exact information in advance. Despite its importance in impacting disassembly outcomes, the existing work fails to consider it comprehensively. This work proposes a stochastic biobjective DSP problem with the objectives of maximizing disassembly profit and minimizing energy consumption by doing so. A chance-constrained programming model is established, where a chance constraint ensures a fixed confidence level of disassembly failure.

The study also explores the impact of demographic characteristics as moderating factors between the religious factors and perceptions of GRP systems in Saudi government agencies. Not many studies have been conducted on religious values concerning to what extent technological innovation is embraced. Most research on the effects of cultural norms has been conducted in Western countries and little has been published on Arab nations. This research fills that knowledge gap by investigating the effect of religious values on public sector employees’ adoption of technological innovation in Saudi Arabia. Theoretically, this study related to religious factors will facilitate an understanding of the issues affecting individual employees’ adoption of new technologies in the workplace context where conservative social and religious values hold sway. The study developed a conceptual model based on two theories: Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology and Theory of Reasoned Action. The sample data comprised 340 responses to an online survey questionnaire sent to employees at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Saudi Arabia. Data were analyzed using multivariate statistical analysis. Results show that 37% of the variance ( ${\mathrm {R}}^{2}=.372$ ) of employees’ attitudes to GRP application can be explained by the effect of religious variables. Findings show that the religious factors - perfection (Itqan) (t (340) =7.678,  $\text{p} < 0.000$ ), cooperation (Ta’awun) (t (340) =4.007,  $\text{p} < 0.000$ ), and transparency (Shaffaf) (t (340) =4.700,  $\text{p} < 0.000$ ) exerted a significant effect on users’ attitude to the system’s usage. However, responsibility (Mas’uliyyah (t (340) =1.284,  $\text{p} < 0.200$ ) did not reveal any level of significance. This research will help managers identify and benchmark strategies to motivate technology adoption in their workplaces and customize them to best fit their users’ unique characteristics in a traditional and conservative society such as Saudi Arabia.

To efficiently manage them according to the autonomic computing paradigm, service-based business processes can be associated with autonomic managers that monitor these processes, analyze monitoring data, plan configuration actions, and execute these actions on these processes. Although, during these last years, autonomic management of cloud services has received increasing attention, the optimization of autonomic managers to be assigned to cloud services remains not well explored. In fact, almost all the existing solutions on autonomic computing have been interested in modeling and implementing autonomic mechanisms without making any effort to optimize the number of used autonomic managers. Moreover, when it comes to large service-based business processes, optimization of management resources becomes a critical issue. To overcome this issue, we present in this paper a novel approach to determine how many autonomic managers to use for the management of large service-based business processes in order to minimize their cost while avoiding management bottlenecks.

However, the traditional centralized workflow management technology can no longer meet the needs of current application services. For example, in e-commerce, cross-enterprise business applications may cause many security problems and cross-domain problems in the implementation of workflow. At the same time, due to the uncertainty and variability of environment and user requirements in practical applications, many business logics are difficult to be completely defined in advance. Therefore workflow models need to be immediately built or adjusted dynamically. Nowadays, distributed scheduling and decentralized control of workflow have become the emerging trend and are facing many challenges at the forefront of Internet development technology. In this paper, a distributed workflow control execution method based on “meta-process” is proposed. Specifically, we designed and implemented a decentralized distributed scheduling management system for workflow tasks. To manage and control the distributed scheduling of workflow, we constructed a “meta-process”, which can ensure the integrity of the control chain in the distributed scheduling process. Our system can efficiently handle the data state migration between task nodes and supports the dynamic adjustment of the workflow model. For validation, we simulated a large number of service scheme samples and applied them to the system, which proved that all service cases can be executed correctly. Therefore, the feasibility of this method is verified.","","978-1-6654-4045-5","10.1109/ICSS53362.2021.00014","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9492200","workflow;distributed scheduling;decentralization","Uncertainty;Decentralized control;Process control;Market research;Data models;Internet;Security","business data processing;electronic commerce;Internet;scheduling;security of data;workflow management software","electronic commerce;workflow systems;traditional centralized workflow management technology;application services;cross-enterprise business applications;security problems;cross-domain problems;business logics;workflow model;Internet development technology;distributed workflow control execution method;meta-process;decentralized distributed scheduling management system;workflow tasks;distributed scheduling process;decentralized execution;internet usage;enterprise-wide;automating interorganizational interactions","","1","","22","IEEE","26 Jul 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The leakage can happen while the data is at rest (in storage), in processing, or on moving within a cloud or between different cloud infrastructures, e.g., from private to public clouds. This paper focuses on protecting data “in processing”. For big data applications, the MapReduce framework has been proven as an efficient solution and has been widely deployed, e.g., in healthcare and business data analysis. In this article, we propose a trust-based framework for MapReduce in big data processing tasks. Specifically, we first quantify and propose to assign the sensitive values for data and trust values for map and reduce slots. We then compute the trust value of each resource employed in the big data processing tasks. Depending on the data's sensitivity level of a task, the task requires a given level of trust (i.e., higher sensitive data requires servers/slots with higher trust level). The MapReduce scheduling problem is then formulated as the maximum weighted matching problem of a bipartite graph that aims to maximize the total trust value over all possible assignments subject to various trust requirement of different tasks. The problem is known to be NP-hard. To tackle it, we observe that within a computing node (VM), slots share the same trust value granted from the secured transformation phase. This helps reduce the number of slot nodes of a weight bipartite graph. Leveraging this fact, we propose an efficient heuristic algorithm that achieves 94.7 percent of the optimal solution obtained via exhaustive search. Extensive simulations show that the trust-based scheduling scheme provides much higher protection for data sensitivity while ensuring good performance for big data applications.","1939-1374","","10.1109/TSC.2019.2938959","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8823036","Trust-aware framework;data sensitive;big data security;trust-based scheduling;MapReduce","Cloud computing;Task analysis;Processor scheduling;Security;Big Data applications;Measurement;Data privacy;Heuristic algorithms;Trusted computing","Big Data;cloud computing;computational complexity;data analysis;data privacy;graph theory;parallel processing;resource allocation;scheduling;virtual machines","trust-based scheduling framework;private data;public clouds;big data applications;MapReduce framework;healthcare;business data analysis;trust-based framework;big data processing tasks;higher sensitive data;trust level;MapReduce scheduling problem;total trust value;trust requirement;data sensitivity;higher sensitive data","","6","","33","IEEE","3 Sep 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

One limiting assumption that governs the state-of-the-art alignment algorithms relies in a static cost function assigning fixed costs to all the possible types of deviations related to a BP activity, thus neglecting the specific context in which the deviation takes place and flattening the analysis of its potential impact. In this paper, we relax this assumption by providing a technique based on theoretic manipulations of deterministic finite state automata (DFAs) to build optimal alignments driven by dedicated cost models that assign context-dependent variable costs to the deviations. We show how the algorithm can be implemented relying on automated planning in Artificial Intelligence (AI), which is proven to be an effective tool to address the alignment task in the case of BP models and event logs of remarkable size.

In this regard, ‘new employee addition’ has emerged as one of the critical dynamic events that could significantly disrupt the project budget and schedule. In this paper, the SPS is modelled as multi-objective optimization problem and a novel approach is presented to deal with ‘new employee addition’ dynamic event; that uses domain knowledge to generate a robust schedule.

In the process of ensuring planning, the technology of digital transformation of the initial data for filling the block model of deposits, which should not depend on the subjective component, comes to the fore. A hardware-software complex for monitoring changes in the energy indicators of excavation of the inter-well space is proposed, which are proposed to be used as a criterion for mining and technological mapping of rock masses. The obtained accuracy of binding the mapping results under conditions of changes in the parameters of the grid of wells during the transition from one category of rock explosibility to another has been established. In the hardware-software complex, the GPS module has an auxiliary value - only for linking the monitoring results to the terrain. The Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) is of central importance.

An ever-increasing amount of data is being created each day, and the power to analyze this data requires the use of cluster computers to process and calculate data. It has been discovered that data clustering is a beneficial data mining approach. There have been a number of recent attempts to cluster data mining methods. Using a Raspberry Pi cluster, this study employs the Apriori algorithm, which is the most generally used algorithm, to extract frequent itemsets from large data sets. The fundamental aim is to build a cluster and provide data analysis capabilities based on an examination of the major clustering phases in order to illustrate the power of cluster computing and the applications of data analytics. Each Raspberry Pi uses the MPI standard and Python multiprocessing to share a large task and then coordinate their findings among a group of four or more MPICH systems at the conclusion of the processing. At the data partitioning stage, the issue of load balancing must be taken into account. According to our testing results, clustering accelerates sequential classification by a factor of 10. There is a noticeable increase in performance when there are additional processors installed. Additionally, we discovered that item count had a bigger effect on clustering performance than transaction count.","","978-1-6654-5294-6","10.1109/ICCA56443.2022.10039629","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10039629","Data Clustering;Data Mining;Parallel Programming;High Performance;Apriori Algorithm","Clustering algorithms;Cluster computing;Life estimation;Parallel processing;Load management;Supercomputers;Data mining","data analysis;data mining;message passing;parallel processing;pattern classification;pattern clustering;Python;resource allocation","Apriori algorithm;cluster computing;data analysis;data analytics;data clustering;data mining;data partitioning;high-performance cluster;load balancing;MPI standard;Python multiprocessing;Raspberry Pi cluster;sequential classification","","","","23","IEEE","14 Feb 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Since the above-mentioned problem is NP-Hard, it poses challenges to obtain the optimal solution within polynomial time, the problem is transformed into a many-to-one-to-one 3D matching problem. To further reduce the computation while ensuring the matching stability, we first adopt the spectral clustering algorithm to cluster the clients into multiple client clusters.

The former is the default scheduler, and the latter is used to recover from higher memory pressure. We devised Memory State Machine to track the memory consumption and switch schedulers.

While, human limits of domain knowledge and experience restrict decision making, AI with its superior information processing abilities aims at overcoming cognition and complexity. Executives accept that AI will impact workforces as routine and logic based tasks become automated, leading to an increase in demand for EI skills. Even though AI is yet to replace skilled professionals, EI is what machines will remain deprived of. However forging of data, technology and emotional intelligence might be crucial to build an effective decision.

In this article, we present a novel approach to design and control smart manufacturing systems. The approach is reactive, that is responds to unplanned situations and implements an iterative refinement technique, that is, optimizes itself during runtime to better accommodate production goals. For realizing these advances, we present a model-driven methodology and we provide a prototypical implementation of such a production system. In particular, we employ Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL) as our artificial intelligence environment for automated planning of production processes and combine it with one of the most prominent Industry 4.0 standards for the fundamental production system model: IEC 62264. We show how to plan the assembly of small trucks from available components and how to assign specific production operations to available production resources, including robotic manipulators and transportation system shuttles. Results of the evaluation indicate that the presented approach is feasible and that it is able to significantly strengthen the flexibility of production systems during runtime. Note to Practitioners—Smart production is an umbrella for a number of shifts and initiatives that deal with digitization of manufacturing/production systems and related issues and potentials. In this work, we present an approach for utilizing automated planning for creating production plans. This is in contrast to the traditional approach, where recipes are programmed into the production system ahead-of-time. However, automated planning relies on specific languages and tools that are hard to master by nonexperts, which is a factor that strongly limited the utilization of plan-driven approaches for industrial automation in practice. Thus, we propose to generate planning tasks automatically with model-driven engineering techniques. We are utilizing the industrial standard IEC 62264 for the description of the production system, and the academic standard Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL) for planning. PDDL is handled completely transparent to the user, that is the user is shielded from its complexity by employing the IEC 62264 model as the sole frontend.","1558-3783","","10.1109/TASE.2020.3018402","Austrian Federal Ministry for Digital and Economic Affairs; Österreichische Nationalstiftung für Forschung, Technologie und Entwicklung; Ministry of Education, Youth and Sport of the Czech Republic within the project Cluster 4.0(grant numbers:CZ.02.1.01/0.0/0.0/16_026/0008432); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9190077","Artificial intelligence (AI);computer-aided engineering;flexible manufacturing systems;information processing;iterative methods;systems modeling","Planning;Production systems;Unified modeling language;IEC Standards;Automation","artificial intelligence;control engineering computing;IEC standards;intelligent manufacturing systems;manufacturing systems;planning;planning (artificial intelligence);production control;production engineering computing;production planning;software engineering;specification languages","robotic manipulators;transportation system shuttles;Practitioners-Smart production;production plans;production system ahead-of-time;plan-driven approaches;planning tasks;academic standard Planning Domain Definition Language;iterative plan refinement;reactive Smart manufacturing systems;Industry 4.0 production systems;production processes;iterative refinement technique;production goals;automated planning;fundamental production system model;specific production operations;available production resources","","15","","49","IEEE","9 Sep 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Effective help is difficult to provide for the rapid implementation of emergency response. Therefore, obtaining key emergency task information from the emergency response plan and visualizing the emergency disposal workflow are the main challenges. In this article, we propose a method of extracting emergency elements (EELs) from emergency plans and constructing a business process model. First, a nested entity extraction model incorporating adversarial training is proposed to extract EELs from the complex sentences in the emergency plan text. Second, the EELs are combined into emergency task units, and then the relations between emergency task units are identified to form the emergency task sequence flow, which is stored in matrix form. Finally, the emergency disposal workflow model is generated based on the emergency task sequence flow and the BPMN modeling method. Taking the actual emergency plan text as an example, the process from the extraction of EELs to the construction of the disposal workflow model is demonstrated. Experimental results prove that this method has advantages in comprehensively extracting EELs, visualizing the emergency disposal workflow, and improving the enforceability of emergency plans.","2329-924X","","10.1109/TCSS.2023.3235338","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62272036,62173167,62132003); National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2016YFB1200203); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10026251","Business process modeling notation;deep learning;emergency plan;nested entity extraction;urban rail transit (URT)","Task analysis;Business;Transformers;Semantics;Bit error rate;Training;Rails","","","","","","","IEEE","25 Jan 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

With the increasing use of data mining in production management, it is possible to provide more sophisticated predictions of throughput time. However, current research often does not describe the application or locate the particular prediction approach within the time and task structure of Production Planning and Control (PPC). Therefore, this paper aims to develop a systematisation approach to classify prediction models within the PPC task structure. To this end, applications along the order fulfilment process are first defined and then elaborated. A systematic literature review is conducted to classify current throughput time prediction approaches within the previously described application domains.

Task assignment and incentive design are two essential parts of crowdsensing. However, due to the semi-honest CS and malicious workers, there exist several security and fairness issues. First, during task assigning and reward distributing, CS can get the private information of both task requester and workers such as identity, attributes. Second, malicious workers who are unable to execute tasks can get the task content, which leaks task privacy. Third, most auction-based incentive mechanism only considers the biddings of workers and ignores the real capabilities of workers. To this end, we propose a privacy-preserving fine-grained task assignment scheme for the crowdsensing system. Moreover, we also design a novel incentive mechanism based on the capabilities of workers. To be specific, a ciphertext-policy attribute-based encryption (CP-ABE) scheme with the characteristics of hidden policy is adopted to select workers and protect the privacy that of both requirements and workers' attributes. We quantify the capabilities of workers based on the workers' attributes and further determine the workers' reward according to their capabilities. Detailed security analysis demonstrates that our proposed scheme can protect workers' identity privacy, attribute privacy, and data confidentiality. Besides, the extensive experiments show that our incentive mechanism can effectively motivate workers.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3074142","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61632013); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9408590","Crowdsensing;attribute-based encryption;privacy preservation;task assignment;incentive mechanism","Task analysis;Crowdsensing;Privacy;Encryption;Sensors;Servers;Data privacy","cryptography;data privacy;incentive schemes;Internet of Things;mobile computing;outsourcing;sensor fusion","data confidentiality;identity privacy;detailed security analysis;CP-ABE;ciphertext policy attribute based encryption;auction;private information;outsource sensing;Internet-of-Things;ATM;attribute based privacy preserving task assignment;auction based incentive mechanism;privacy preserving fine grained task assignment scheme;ciphertext policy attribute based encryption scheme;attribute privacy;novel incentive mechanism;task privacy;task content;task assigning;malicious workers;incentive design;CS;crowdsensing server;task requester","","1","","35","CCBY","20 Apr 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The cloud-edge collaborative data storage scheme provides mass storage capability by the cloud data center, and meanwhile takes access delay into account by storing data in the edge servers near to user, making it an effective solution to manage mobile business data in the IIoT scenario.

But in the process of allocation, government staff needs to manually review a lot of work, which increased a lot of pressure to the education management department and wastes a lot of manpower and resources. Moreover, because there are persons take part in the allocation management, the public doesn't have full trust in the allocation. In order to reduce the work pressure of government departments and improve the trust, the government should use blockchain technology to realize management system. By analyzing the business process of student allocation system, the system can store key data with alliance chain technology. Alliance chain breaks through the data barrier of information system among government departments. According to the characteristics of the alliance chain, this paper gave the overall design and business process analysis of the system, and the system experiment finally verified that the blockchain technology has very important significance and feasibility in the sunshine government. The next research work will be to design the application system by using the block chain principle, instead of using the existing block framework.","","978-1-6654-4856-7","10.1109/CTMCD53128.2021.00045","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9463377","Alliance Chain;Sunshine Government;blockchain","Government;Education;Urban areas;Blockchain;Media;Resource management;Business","blockchains;government data processing;teaching","sunshine government affairs;student allocation system;teaching resources;allocation mechanism;government staff;education management department;manpower;allocation management;work pressure;government departments;blockchain technology;management system;business process;alliance chain technology;information system;system experiment;application system;key data storing;block chain principle","","1","","8","IEEE","28 Jun 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this method, the migrating birds optimization with some particular strategies aims at searching candidate solutions from the entire solution domain. Simultaneously, the discrete event system, by using stochastic simulation and discrete event-based simulation approaches, focuses on evaluating the performance of searched solutions.

Therefore, this study proposes a new query to discuss these two issues simultaneously. In this new query, we conduct the following steps: (1) Using the borrowed records of the bicycle sharing system for the location of the query shop, we find out what other locations are most frequently visited by people in the vicinity of the query shop, and consider these locations as key sources of customers; (2) Using NNs to predict the traffic at these key sources; (3) Using GA to find out how to schedule the staff to distribute flyers at these key sources if the shop needs to have such arrangement.

One of the difficulties stated was the resistance of organizational units to the changes in the business process, organizational structure, and work culture. In this article, the roadmapping implementation phases at Arcelik A.S., a durable consumer goods company, utilizing roadmapping as a part of the strategic planning process will be discussed. One of the unique contributions of the Arcelik A.S. case study is that the roadmapping methodology integration to other processes, such as strategic planning, portfolio management, and human resources planning, was done seamlessly. The needs and roadmapping implementation challenges in a company, which is expanding itself from local to global, solutions generated for a more suitable application, and lessons learned for roadmapping continuity will be discussed in detail.

Its challenges mainly come from three aspects: 1) a large number of tasks in a workflow cause large-scale decision variables; 2) the two optimization objectives are of quite different scales; 3) and cloud resources are heterogeneous and elastic. So far, many studies focus on adopting multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) to solve the cloud workflow scheduling problem without mining the domain knowledge. To make a good trade-off between the makespan and monetary cost, this paper puts forward a knowledge-driven multi-objective evolutionary workflow scheduling algorithm, abbreviated as KMEWSA, including two novel features. On the one hand, the structural knowledge of workflow is mined to simplify the large-scale decision variables into a series of small-scale components, such accelerating the convergence speed of MOEAs. On the other hand, the knowledge on the Pareto front range is mined to estimate the ideal and nadir points for the objective space normalization during the search process, which helps maintain population diversity for MOEAs. At last, based on twenty real-world workflows and parameters of Amazon EC2, extensive experiments are performed to compare the KMEWSA with three baseline algorithms. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the KMEWSA in balancing makespan and monetary cost for deploying workflows into cloud computing.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3139137","Key Research Project of Xuchang University: Design of Smart IoT Management and Control System at Substation Side Based on BIM Model and Edge Computing(grant numbers:2021zd004); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9664570","Cloud computing;workflow scheduling;multi-objective optimization;evolutionary algorithm","Task analysis;Cloud computing;Costs;Optimization;Computational modeling;Elasticity;Statistics","cloud computing;evolutionary computation;genetic algorithms;optimisation;Pareto optimisation;scheduling;workflow management software","domain knowledge;monetary cost;KMEWSA;structural knowledge;large-scale decision variables;small-scale components;MOEAs;objective space normalization;real-world workflows;baseline algorithms;cloud computing;multiobjective evolutionary scheduling algorithm;cloud workflows;conflicting optimization objectives;multiobjective optimization problem;multiobjective evolutionary algorithms;cloud workflow scheduling problem","","","","39","CCBY","28 Dec 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The LDA model is used to mine the topic information in the texts in parallel corpora, and the polynomial distribution of thesaurus is used to represent the topic, so as to judge the proportion of each document topic in the document collection. The specific words are obtained according to the polynomial distribution of the corresponding thesaurus of the topic by probability sampling. The monolingual corpus of the target language is processed by maximum likelihood estimation method, and the parallel corpus is taken as the training target. The monolingual corpus of the target language is estimated by importance sampling and full probability formula, and a machine English translation model is established. The estimated expected value is obtained by beam search method, so that English sentence translation can be realized.

Outlier detection over such continuous/streaming data is a challenging task due to its volume and limitations in processing memory. This paper presents an outlier detection approach called Advanced Memory Efficient Outlier Detection (A-MEOD) that is able to find outliers in streaming data in a memory-efficient manner. The outlier detection is based on the MEOD technique and Local Correlation Integral (LOCI) algorithm. Further the A-MEOD technique reduces the LOCI calculations and finds the top M outliers using Knorr’s definition.

By avoiding the need to hire more staff members and reducing the number of hours your present workers are required to work, outsourcing the purchase of hardware may help the business save money. Additionally, you won’t need to continually purchase brand-new IT hardware or software. Additionally, outsourcing can boost production and enable you to provide your consumers with a better and more effective good or service. An iterative technique for maximizing an objective function with sufficient smoothness qualities is stochastic gradient descent or SGD for short. Given that it substitutes an estimate for the real gradient, it may be thought of as a stochastic approximation of gradient descent optimization. This lightens the computational load, especially in high-dimensional optimization problems, leading to quicker iterations at the cost of a reduced convergence rate. We suggest a Stochastic Gradient Descent model for use in a commercial setting where large corporations must purchase the necessary hardware with their software. Our approach assists in determining the necessary hardware requirements based on the demands of the customers.","2768-5330","979-8-3503-9725-3","10.1109/ICICCS56967.2023.10142907","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10142907","Gradient descent;Stochastic gradient descent;Machine learning;Outsourcing hardware.","Productivity;Costs;Gears;Stochastic processes;Organizations;Market research;Hardware","business data processing;gradient methods;iterative methods;optimisation;outsourcing;stochastic processes","brand-new IT hardware;business environment;gradient descent optimization;high-dimensional optimization problems;iterative technique;organization;outsourcing;reduced convergence rate;stochastic approximation;sufficient smoothness qualities","","","","12","IEEE","8 Jun 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The main task of multi-scale data mining has two aspects, namely, multi-scale realization of data and multi-scale discovery of knowledge: the former belongs to data preprocessing, which can be realized by data scale division. The latter needs to improve the specific mining technology, excavate knowledge in the multi-scale representation of data, analyze and deduce the relationship between knowledge. How to find the valuable information in the mass data and the security risks in the network is one of the problems to be solved in the information processing technology. The clustering analysis method in data mining technology is to cluster the data with high similarity according to the similarity measurement standard. Therefore, the data objects in the same cluster are more similar to those in different clusters. With the prevalence of supply side reform and the implementation of Rural Revitalization Strategy, the agriculture of the primary industry takes advantage of the situation. From the perspective of urban-rural system, rural development plays an important role in the growth of cities and regions.

Proposed parameter is used to rank activities on a scale based on their criticality to develop a heuristic. It was observed that the proposed intelligent heuristic performed better on well-known benchmark datasets in terms of both lead times and computation time.

All dangerous factors characterizing emergencies require generation of a complex approach to ensure security in the Arctic territories, increasing the rescue services resource potential and providing monitoring the environment components state and pollution. This article identifies ways to solve the problem of strategic planning and deployment of forces and facilities when creating an integrated security system under resource constraints and dynamically changing situation in the Arctic.

In this paper, we propose two user models for the P2P task offloading system: honest user model and strategy user model. For the honest user model, we formulate the resource allocation maximization problem with latency and energy consumption constraints as an Integer Linear Programming. We show that the solution for honest user model can output 189% resource transactions of that for the strategic users.

We first group the mobile users based on the connected components to improve the efficiency of double auction. Then we utilize the McAfee Double Auction to price the resource transactions. Finally, we split each winning mobile user of double auction into multiple virtual mobile users, and use the matching approach to calculate the resource allocation.

Distributional representation for network parameters or value functions is usually an effective way to improve the exploration ability of the RL agent. However, directly changing the representation form of network parameters from fixed values to function distributions may cause algorithm instability and low learning inefficiency. Therefore, to accelerate and stabilize parameter distribution learning, a novel inference-based posteriori parameter distribution optimization (IPPDO) algorithm is proposed. From the perspective of solving the evidence lower bound of probability, we, respectively, design the objective functions for continuous-action and discrete-action tasks of parameter distribution optimization based on inference. In order to alleviate the overestimation of the value function, we use multiple neural networks to estimate value functions with Retrace, and the smaller estimate participates in the network parameter update; thus, the network parameter distribution can be learned. After that, we design a method used for sampling weight from network parameter distribution by adding an activation function to the standard deviation of parameter distribution, which achieves the adaptive adjustment between fixed values and distribution. Furthermore, this IPPDO is a deep RL (DRL) algorithm based on off-policy, which means that it can effectively improve data efficiency by using off-policy techniques such as experience replay. We compare IPPDO with other prevailing DRL algorithms on the OpenAI Gym and MuJoCo platforms. Experiments on both continuous-action and discrete-action tasks indicate that IPPDO can explore more in the action space, get higher rewards faster, and ensure algorithm stability.","2168-2275","","10.1109/TCYB.2020.3023127","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61976215,61772532,U1813203); National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2019YFA0706200,2019YFB1703600); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9216634","Exploration;inference;parameter distribution;reinforcement learning (RL)","Task analysis;Optimization;Training;Artificial neural networks;Linear programming;Inference algorithms;Markov processes","deep learning (artificial intelligence);inference mechanisms;multi-agent systems;optimisation;reinforcement learning","reinforcement learning;distributional representation;network parameters;value function;RL agent;parameter distribution learning;IPPDO;objective functions;neural networks;network parameter update;network parameter distribution;activation function;deep RL;inference-based posteriori parameter distribution optimization;continuous-action task;discrete-action task;probability;evidence lower bound","Algorithms;Learning;Neural Networks, Computer;Reinforcement, Psychology;Research Design","2","","48","IEEE","7 Oct 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Thus hotel planning should be done very carefully. It is noticed that many hotels are running in the loss in India or other countries due to faulty planning and management. There is a need for proper scientific planning before constructing any hotel. Measurement of different parameters and criteria should be carefully verified and monitored by using statistical tools before the project is begun.

Big data mining engine is also limited by its professional use mode, resulting in a skill threshold. At the same time, the popularity of mobile terminals makes people's working environment no longer fixed. In the case that the cluster is often shared by multiple users, a single task often occupies a large amount of computing resources, and the mining of the same data by multiple tasks will inevitably produce repeated operations, which will bring about problems such as low scheduling flexibility, idle resources and low processing efficiency. QoS (Quality of Service) is an important nonfunctional parameter that affects user experience. However, QoS parameter values are generally not easy to obtain, so the typical Web service recommendation system has the problem of sparse QoS data, which reduces the accuracy of prediction.

The removal of irrelevant and redundant features from data while simultaneously avoiding information loss is the main objective of feature selection. Feature selection is possible using rough set theory and meta-heuristic algorithms. In this paper, a novel auction-based optimization algorithm (ABOA) is proposed to contribute to generating an effective algorithm with a good trade-off between exploration and exploitation. This new algorithm simulates the auction sale process, where bidders offer higher/lower amounts to outbid each other. Auctions are categorized into ascending auctions and descending auctions and thus respectively represent maximization and minimization problems in ABOA. In the first step of the ABOA after initialization, a predefined number of bidders is selected and an auction is performed between them. The winner is selected and another auction is performed between the winner and a predefined number of the winner’s neighbors. The winner of this round of auction is added to the winner list. This process is iterated until a predefined number of winners is found. Finally, one more auction is performed between all the winners on the winner list and the winner of that auction becomes the final winner. The algorithm with different parameter setting scenarios is tested on 25 benchmark test functions. The algorithm with the best results is then used to perform feature selection on 18 UCI datasets. The feature selection and classification accuracy results are compared with state-of-the-art results. The statistical analysis of the results proves the ability of the algorithm to solve optimization problems.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3098808","National University of Malaysia(grant numbers:DIP-2016-024); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9492077","Artificial intelligence;auction-based optimization algorithm;feature selection;rough set theory","Optimization;Feature extraction;Classification algorithms;Rough sets;Data mining;Task analysis","data mining;electronic commerce;learning (artificial intelligence);optimisation;pattern classification;rough set theory;statistical analysis","novel auction-based optimization algorithm;rough set feature selection;irrelevant features;redundant features;rough set theory;meta-heuristic algorithms;ABOA;auction sale process;ascending auctions;descending auctions;predefined number;winner list;final winner","","5","","70","CCBY","20 Jul 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Mobile edge computing (MEC) is an effective solution to alleviating the problem via task offloading. In the mining process, miners compete for rewards through puzzle solving, where only the miner that first completes the process will be rewarded. Thus, miners may wish to pay higher price and use more communication resources in task offloading and more computation resources in task processing for latency reduction. However, there are risks for the miners not profiting from consuming more resources or paying a higher price, so miners are rational in blockchain systems. In order to maximize the rational total profit of all miners, we use an asynchronous advantage actor-critic (A3C) deep reinforcement learning algorithm to obtain the resource pricing and allocation, considering the stochastic properties of wireless channels, and the prospect theory is employed to strike a good balance between risks and rewards. Numerical results show that our proposed A3C based joint optimization algorithm converges fast and outperforms the baseline algorithms in terms of the total reward.","2327-4697","","10.1109/TNSE.2021.3068340","Natural Science Foundation of Shaanxi Province(grant numbers:2020JQ-844); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61901367,61871321,62001357); Science, and Technology Innovation Team of Shaanxi Province for Broadband Wireless, and Application(grant numbers:2017KCT-30-02); National Science and Technology Major Project(grant numbers:2016ZX03001016); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9385791","Asynchronous advantage actor-critic (A3C);blockchain;deep reinforcement learning;mobile edge computing;pricing;resource allocation","Wireless communication;Multi-access edge computing;Simulation;Reinforcement learning;Pricing;Blockchains;Resource management","blockchains;data mining;deep learning (artificial intelligence);mobile computing;optimisation;reinforcement learning;resource allocation","task offloading;mining process;communication resources;computation resources;task processing;asynchronous advantage actor-critic deep reinforcement learning algorithm;resource pricing;MEC enabled blockchain systems;mobile systems;computation intensive mining tasks;mobile miner equipment;mobile edge computing","","15","","41","IEEE","24 Mar 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, in many real-world applications, the distribution of data is skewed. If the standard models, which are designed to optimize the accuracy, are applied to the imbalanced data, the prediction performance could be poor because the model bias towards the majority class. To address the imbalanced data mining problem, areas under precision-recall curves (AUPRC) was proposed as a good measure to evaluate the performance of prediction models on imbalanced data sets, and shows excellent capability in identifying the models with high predictive power. To improve the performance of models, researchers recently design methods to directly optimize AUPRC for imbalanced data mining. However, these approaches suffer from a high iteration complexity and efficient methods are desired. In this paper, we propose a faster stochastic method (i.e., ROAP) for maximizing the AURPC based on the momentum-based variance reduced technique. Our new method is based on the maximization of non-parametric averaged precision (AP), which is a popular unbiased point estimator of AUPRC, and the optimization objective in this paper can be converted into a sum of dependent compositional functions, where the inner functions rely on random variables of both inner and outer levels. Compared to previous methods, our ROAP algorithm can achieve a lower iteration complexity of $O(\epsilon^{-3})$ for finding an ϵ-stationary solution. Furthermore, we extend our method to an adaptive version (i.e., AROAP) with the same iteration complexity of $O(\epsilon^{-3})$. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first work showing that the variance reduction method can be incorporated into maximizing the AURPC for efficient data mining on imbalanced datasets.

However, with the increasing establishment of the train station, and the increasing complex environment, the number of cameras in the station has dramaticlly growing. Traditional human monitoring methods have difficult to bear the increasingly heavy monitoring tasks, so we propose a recommendation system for intelligent monitoring of railway transport. Unlike the recommendation systems in other fields, the railway oriented recommendation system has a limited number of users, and the user’s viewing focus is highly related to the train arrival and departure schedule.

Then a continuously variable coefficient is introduced and its optimal solution is found. Finally a valid task partition strategy that closet to the optimal solution can be found, and the system delay is minimized. Simulation results show that the reasonable loading of edge node tasks to the cloud can effectively reduce the total system delay of power business and alleviate network congestion.

Furthermore, to ensure an equal service opportunity for the IoTDs and an equal energy consumption (EC) level for the UAVs, the issues of the TLR-fairness between IoTDs and the EC-fairness between UAVs are also considered.

The data structures we designed can effectively meet all requirements that are brought due to tasks and participants gathering online. In addition, based on the designed data structures, we study online large-scale heterogeneous task allocation problem from three aspects: the computing pattern, the tree creation method, and the extension of matching strategy. Our best method (TsPY) is based on parallel computing in the computing pattern, adopts time first and then space in the tree creation method, and increases the short-distance first strategy in the matching strategy. Finally, we conducted detailed experiments under the conditions of different participant geographical distributions (i.e., uniform distribution, Gaussian distribution, and check-in empirical distribution), different sensing methods (i.e., participatory sensing and opportunistic sensing), and different recommendation methods (i.e., point recommendation and trajectory recommendation). The experimental results show that TsPY has a good performance in multiple indicators such as algorithm running time, task-participant matching rate, participant travel distance, and redundant tasks removed. Compared with serial computing, parallel computing can reduce the algorithm running time by more than 66% on average in our experimental environment. Compared with space first and then time, creating a tree based on time first and then space can increase task-participant matching rate by more than 13% on average.

How can we perform both tasks in-house, i.e., without any post-hoc processing, so that both detection and assignment can benefit simultaneously from each other? Presenting outliers in separate micro-clusters is informative to analysts in many real-world applications. However, a naïve solution based on post-hoc clustering of the outliers detected by any existing method suffers from two main drawbacks: (a) appropriate hyperparameter values are commonly unknown for clustering, and most algorithms struggle with clusters of varying shapes and densities; (b) detection and assignment cannot benefit from one another. In this paper, we propose D.MCA to Detect outliers with explicit Micro-Cluster Assignment. Our method performs both detection and assignment iteratively, and in-house, by using a novel strategy that prunes entire micro-clusters out of the training set to improve the performance of the detection. It also benefits from a novel strategy that avoids clustered outliers to mask each other, which is a well-known problem in the literature. Also, D.MCA is designed to be robust to a critical hyperparameter by employing a hyperensemble “warm up” phase. Experiments performed on 16 real-world and synthetic datasets demonstrate that D.MCA outperforms 8 state-of-the-art competitors, especially on the explicit outlier micro-cluster assignment task.","2374-8486","978-1-6654-5099-7","10.1109/ICDM54844.2022.00119","Carnegie Mellon University; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10027707","outlier detection;outlier micro-cluster assignment;hyperparameter robustness","Training;Shape;Clustering algorithms;Robustness;Task analysis;Anomaly detection;Synthetic data","data mining;image colour analysis;learning (artificial intelligence);object detection;pattern clustering","D.MCA;detect outliers;explicit MicroCluster Assignment;explicit MicroCluster assignments;explicit outlier microcluster assignment task;outlier detection;post-hoc clustering;post-hoc processing;prunes entire microclusters;respective microclusters","","","","14","IEEE","1 Feb 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Firstly, selecting the most suitable employees for transfer to an organizational unit (OU), that is without the employment of new candidates. Secondly, enabling an exchange of employees between OUs, constrained with the employees' skills and OUs requirements. Thirdly, avoiding overlapping of employees in OUs for a previously defined timeframe. Finally, the travelling time and distance have to be within the given limits.

However, with the growing number of terminal devices requiring computation offloading to the edge servers, the network would be heavily congested and thus the performance would be degraded and unbalanced among multiple devices. In this paper, we propose the joint admission control and computation resource allocation in the MEC enabled SCN, and formulate it as a stochastic optimization problem. The goal is to maximize the system utility combining the throughput and fairness while bounding the queue. We decouple the original problem into three independent subproblems, which can be solved in a distributed manner without requiring the system statistical information. An admission control and computation resource allocation (ACCRA) algorithm is designed to obtain the optimal solutions of the subproblems. Theoretical analysis proves that the ACCRA algorithm can achieve the close-to-optimal system utility and reach the arbitrary tradeoff between the utility and the queue length.

This big data needs a platform beyond the traditional data possessing context that relies on some computational servers communicating through a network in its lower layer. One of the most important challenges in data processing is how to transfer the big batches of data between the servers to achieve fast responsiveness. Consequently, the underlying network plays a critical role in the performance of a big data analysis platform. Ideally, this network must use the shortest path that has the lowest amount of load, to transfer the large-scale data. To address this issue, we propose a software-defined networking (SDN) enabled scheduling method that uses the tabu search algorithm to schedule big data tasks. The proposed algorithm not only considers data locality but also uses the network traffic status for efficient scheduling. Our extensive simulative study in the Mininet emulator shows that the proposed scheme gives high performance and minimizes job completion time.","1976-5541","","10.23919/JCN.2023.000002","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10077470","Big data;cross-layer;Hadoop;OpenFlow;software defined networking;task scheduling","Big Data;Task analysis;Control systems;Optical switches;Servers;Bandwidth;Social networking (online)","Big Data;cloud computing;computer network security;data analysis;scheduling;search problems;software defined networking;telecommunication traffic","big data analysis platform;big data tasks scheduling;business;computational servers;data locality;data processing;information technology;large-scale data;network traffic status;software-defined networking;tabu search algorithm;tabu search approach;traditional data possessing context","","","","","","20 Mar 2023","","","KICS","KICS Journals"

This work aims to develop a general method for predicting seizures in specific patients through exploring the time-frequency correlation of features obtained from multi-channel EEG signals. We convert the original EEG signals into spectrograms that represent time-frequency characteristics by applying short-time Fourier transform (STFT) to the EEG signals. For the first time, we propose a dual self-attention residual network (RDANet) that combines a spectrum attention module integrating local features with global features, with a channel attention module mining the interdependence between channel mappings to achieve better forecasting performance. Our proposed approach achieved a sensitivity of 89.33%, a specificity of 93.02%, an AUC of 91.26% and an accuracy of 92.07% on 13 patients from the public CHB-MIT scalp EEG dataset.

With the development of hardware technology, the emergence of multi-core processors has made a tremendous breakthrough in the data processing capability of processors. Nevertheless, multi-link transmission is based on allocating tasks and data transmission at the operating system level. Some software programs cannot support multi-threaded operations, resulting in low utilization of underlying hardware resources and high data transmission delay, affecting data transmission. Therefore, this paper uses a data processing and forwarding mechanism under the joint control of multi-threading.

The platform coordinating the MCS campaigns often engineers these choices by selecting MCS tasks to recommend to users and offering monetary or in-kind rewards to motivate their contributions to them. In this paper, we revisit the well-investigated question of how to optimize the contributions of mobile end users to MCS tasks. However, we depart from the bulk of related literature by explicitly accounting for the bounded rationality evidenced in human decision making. Bounded rationality is a consequence of cognitive and other kinds of constraints, e.g., time pressure, and has been studied extensively in behavioral science. We first draw on work in the field of cognitive psychology to model the way boundedly rational users respond to MCS task offers as Fast-and-Frugal-Trees (FFTs). With each MCS task modeled as a vector of feature values, the decision process in FFTs proceeds through sequentially parsing lexicographically ordered features, resulting in choices that are satisfying but not necessarily optimal. We then formulate, analyze and solve the novel optimization problems that emerge for both nonprofit and for-profit MCS platforms in this context. The evaluation of our optimization approach highlights significant gains in both platform revenue and quality of task contributions when compared to heuristic rules that do not account for the lexicographic structure in human decision making. We show how this modeling framework readily extends to platforms that present multiple task offers to the users. Finally, we discuss how these models can be trained, iterate on their assumptions, and point to their implications for applications beyond MCS, where end-users make choices through the mediation of mobile/online platforms.","1558-0660","","10.1109/TMC.2020.3023757","Hellenic Foundation for Research and Innovation; General Secretariat for Research and Technology(grant numbers:892); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9195750","Mobile crowdsensing;incentive allocation;bounded rationality;task recommendation;decision trees;user choice engineering","Task analysis;Decision making;Crowdsensing;Computational modeling;Resource management;Psychology;Mobile applications","behavioural sciences computing;decision making;mobile computing;optimisation;psychology;trees (mathematics)","task contributions;human decision making;multiple task offers;mobile crowdsensing platforms;MCS campaigns;optimization problems;fast-and-frugal-trees;cognitive psychology;behavioral science","","7","","38","IEEE","14 Sep 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Traditional cloud-based video analytics relies on large centralized clusters to ingest video streams. With edge computing, we can offload compute-intensive analysis tasks to nearby servers, thus mitigating long latency incurred by data transmission via wide area networks. When offloading video frames from the front-end device to an edge server, the application configuration (i.e., frame sampling rate and frame resolution) will impact several metrics, such as energy consumption, analytics accuracy and user-perceived latency. In this paper, we study the configuration selection and bandwidth allocation for multiple video streams, which are connected to the same edge node sharing an upload link. We propose an efficient online algorithm, called JCAB, which jointly optimizes configuration adaption and bandwidth allocation to address a number of key challenges in edge-based video analytics systems, including edge capacity limitation, unknown network variation, intrusive dynamics of video contents. Our algorithm is developed based on Lyapunov optimization and Markov approximation, works online without requiring future information, and achieves a provable performance bound. We also extend the proposed algorithms to the multi-edge scenario in which each user or video stream has an additional choice about which edge server to connect.

We address a scheduling problem of the robotic cell that determines a robot task sequence when two part types are processed in a different set of machines and all machines have variable processing times within a given interval. The objective is to minimize the makespan. This study proposes a learning-based method, i.e., a reinforcement learning (RL) approach, for the first time, to address a dual-gripper robotic cell scheduling problem. The problem is modeled with a Petri net, a graphical and mathematical modeling tool, which is used as an environment in RL. The states, actions, and rewards are defined by using flow shop scheduling properties, features from a Petri net, and knowledge from previous studies of scheduling robotized tools. Then, the RL approach is compared to the first-in-first-out (FIFO) rule, which is generally used in practice, a swap sequence, which is widely used for cyclic scheduling of dual-gripper robotic cells, and a lower bound. The extensive experiments show that the proposed method performs better than FIFO and the swap sequence; moreover, the gap between the makespan of the proposed method and the lower bound is not large. Note to Practitioners—We address a scheduling problem of dual-gripper robotic cells with two-part types when all machines have processing time variations.

Artificial intelligence is used by these bots to comprehend human input and react appropriately. The three most important areas to focus on are medicine/health, agriculture, and education. Nowadays, chatbots can be utilized anyplace a person can talk to a computer at any time. The fastest expanding sectors for hiring are customer service, sales, marketing, and branding, as well as human resources. This prediction tasks are now carried out by other chatbots (especially in the medical industry), made possible by developments in AI and data mining methods. The number of patients is rising quickly every day as lifestyles change, just like in the modern world. As a result, both the hospital and the local health care systems are expanding quickly. Patients with hectic schedules must wait a long time for doctors. Some diseases take longer to recover from. Around the world, heart disease and ENT diseases are prevalent issues. 4,444 people, both young and elderly, pass away from heart attacks every day. The main challenges of cardio patients are they do not know how to prevent and cure the diseases and the solutions are not available for their doubts. In order to improve both business and healthcare outcomes, healthcare practitioners will be able to collect data remotely, diagnose patients accurately from a distance, and use AI to evaluate data.

Moreover, promotion programs will incur costs, so we need to predict not only the effect of recommending programs to users, but also the cost of programs. So it is essentially an NP-hard optimization problem with a budget constraint. Recently, there are some studies that conducts causal inferences for analyzing the effects of various designed programs on users. However, causal inference models mostly address the expected effects of treatments instead of studying the probabilistic distribution of the heterogeneous effects on users, thus unable to help on accurate estimation of the program costs driven by events. In this paper, we argue that the expected treatment effects can be learned with the response distribution, and proposed a multi-task learning model for composite causal inference on both treatment effects and response distribution, which allows decision makers to make trade-off decisions on the return and cost of programs in an end-to-end manner and to optimize their policy and strategy.","","978-1-6654-8045-1","10.1109/BigData55660.2022.10020346","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10020346","causal inference;assignment optimization;distribution prediction;tiered treatments","Costs;Estimation;Big Data;Predictive models;Multitasking;Probabilistic logic;Task analysis","business data processing;computational complexity;decision making;inference mechanisms;learning (artificial intelligence);optimisation;recommender systems;statistical distributions","budget constraint;business applications;business targets;causal inference models;click-through-rate prediction;composite causal inference;customer experience;event driven promotion programs;expected treatment effects;heterogeneous effects;multiple tiered treatment optimization;multitask learning model;multitiered programs;NP-hard optimization problem;probabilistic distribution;program cost estimation;program costs;response distribution;trade-off decision making;traditional recommendation methods","","","","35","IEEE","26 Jan 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The DIRS framework includes centralized training relying on the global information and distributed decision making by each agent deployed in each MEC server. Specifically, we first introduce a novel multiagent ensemble-assisted distributed deep reinforcement learning (DRL) architecture, which can simplify the overall neural network structure of each agent by partitioning the state space and also improve the performance of a single agent by combining decisions of all the agents. Second, we apply action refinement to enhance the exploration ability of the proposed DIRS framework, where the near-optimal state-action pairs are obtained by a novel Levy flight search. Finally, an imitation acceleration scheme is presented to pretrain all the agents, which can significantly accelerate the learning process of the proposed framework through learning the professional experience from a small amount of demonstration data.

In recent years, deep learning has achieved fruitful results in RSIR. However, there are three major problems. The first problem is due to the imbalanced categories in RSIR data sets. Accordingly, a novel sample mining method is proposed. This method is based on top- $k$  “misplaced” samples (Top- $k$  MS) along the top- $k$  nearest neighbor decision boundary, rather than setting boundary threshold of sample mining and reducing the impact of artificial and objective factors on network training as usual. The second problem comes from the inconsistency between the loss reduction direction and the optimization direction. In response, we additionally propose a novel result ranking loss (RRL) according to the retrieval results in a batch. RRL is used as a plug-in and combined with other local losses. As a result, the retrieval accuracy improved significantly. For the third problem, processing a large number of high-resolution images will increase training time and cause network freeze. To solve the problem, this article proposes a global optimization model based on feature space and retrieval results (FSRR). More specifically, FSRR consists of local loss based on feature space and RRL based on retrieval results, and can be optimized in an end-to-end manner.

Efficient extraction of useful information from the volumes of data has garnered growing interest from academics and the industry. Data mining research focuses on finding utility patterns in large datasets. But the inherent complications like frequent scans, creation of substantial candidate sets, etc. plague the mining process for large datasets. Distributive architecture-based approaches also prove inefficacious due to high communication overhead over iterations. High communication cost over data exchange both locally and remotely further aggravates the situation. We propose a Communication Cost Effective Utility-based Pattern Mining (CEUPM) algorithm based on the Spark framework to address this issue. Spark accelerates iterative scanning by storing scanned datasets in a memory abstraction called resilient distributed datasets (RDD). RDD operations need a redistribution of data among cluster nodes during processing. To minimize the communication cost incurred during the shuffle process, we adopt a search space division strategy based on data parallelism for a fair and effective task allocation across cluster nodes. Communication overhead is incurred during this redistribution or shuffle process while minimizing costs. Experimental results in four real datasets demonstrate that CEUPM considerably reduces shuffling overhead and outperforms other existing methods in terms of memory usage, communication cost, execution time, and scalability.","1558-2183","","10.1109/TPDS.2022.3221210","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9944926","Communication cost;distributed computing;high utility pattern mining;scalability;spark","Data mining;Costs;Sparks;Distributed databases;Task analysis;Cluster computing;Scalability","data mining;minimisation;pattern clustering","CEUPM;cluster nodes;communication cost effective utility-based pattern mining algorithm;cost minimisation;current digital era;data exchange;data mining research;data parallelism;distributive architecture-based approaches;high-communication cost;information transmission technologies;iterative scanning;mining process;RDD operations;resilient distributed datasets;scanned datasets;shuffle process;Spark;substantial candidate sets;utility patterns;utility-based distributed pattern mining algorithm","","1","","61","IEEE","10 Nov 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In these systems, workflows consist of several abstract tasks, of which instances are run in parallel and transform input partitions into output partitions. Resource managers like Kubernetes execute such workflow tasks on cluster infrastructures. However, these resource managers only consider the number of CPUs and the amount of available memory when assigning tasks to resources; they do not consider hardware differences beyond these numbers, while computational speed and memory access rates can differ significantly.We propose Tarema, a system for allocating task instances to heterogeneous cluster resources during the execution of scalable scientific workflows. First, Tarema profiles the available infrastructure with a set of benchmark programs and groups cluster nodes with similar performance. Second, Tarema uses online monitoring data of tasks, assigning labels to tasks depending on their resource usage. Third, Tarema uses the node groups and task labels to dynamically assign task instances evenly to resources based on resource demand. Our evaluation of a prototype implementation for Kubernetes, using five real-world Nextflow workflows from the popular nf-core framework and two 15-node clusters consisting of different virtual machines, shows a mean reduction of isolated job runtimes by 19.8% compared to popular schedulers in widely-used resource managers and 4.54% compared to the heuristic SJFN, while providing a better cluster usage. Moreover, executing two long-running workflows in parallel and on restricted resources shows that Tarema is able to reduce the runtimes even more while providing a fair cluster usage.","","978-1-6654-3902-2","10.1109/BigData52589.2021.9671519","Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9671519","Resource Management;Scientific Workflows;Profiling;Heterogeneous Cluster Resources;Scheduling","Runtime;Memory management;Prototypes;Big Data;Benchmark testing;Task analysis;Yarn","application program interfaces;business data processing;data analysis;resource allocation;scheduling;software architecture;virtual machines;workflow management software","widely-used resource managers;restricted resources;Tarema;fair cluster usage;adaptive resource allocation;scalable scientific workflows;heterogeneous clusters;scientific workflow management systems;Nextflow support large-scale data analysis;input partitions;output partitions;Kubernetes;workflow tasks;cluster infrastructures;memory access rates;heterogeneous cluster resources;online monitoring data;resource usage;task labels;resource demand;real-world Nextflow workflows;15-node clusters","","10","","43","IEEE","13 Jan 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The problem that exists in the organisation's supply chain cycle is the lack of data transparency across the teams. The data is stored and managed by each individual division manually, resulting in a lack of integration causing a discontinuity in the process flows. This study analyses the importance of using a Value Stream Mapping (VSM) in planning, scheduling, and logistics processes at a petroleum company that is part of a joint venture refinery and its importance in an integrated digital system. The major findings from using Value Stream Mapping (VSM) are the value of time and costs in improving efficiencies, the appreciation of the existing technologies used in the petroleum industry, and the importance of using integrated digital technologies to improve systems. The study concludes that using an improved VSM to integrate the digital system is vital in the supply chain for both internal and external use in the organisation as the 4th Industrial Revolution (4IR) systems require rapid responses.","","978-1-6654-8817-4","10.1109/ICE/ITMC-IAMOT55089.2022.10033320","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10033320","4IR;Enterprise Resource Planning;Integration;Supply Chain Management;Value Stream Mapping","Visualization;Job shop scheduling;Costs;Digital systems;Supply chains;Companies;Real-time systems","lean production;logistics;organisational aspects;petroleum industry;production engineering computing;supply chain management","business function;data transparency;improved VSM;integrated digital system;integrated digital technologies;logistics processes;logistics team;organisation;petroleum company;petroleum industry;supply chain;Value Stream Mapping","","","","21","IEEE","10 Feb 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Here comes the role of the security systems and police. There are three main types of patrols such as land patrols, marine patrols, and air force patrols. Police are assigned to combat various kinds of crimes and carry many tasks such as search and rescue operations, securing and organizing events. Therefore, the time and location where crimes occur should be predicted, so that all the needed procedures are taken. Further it becomes very necessary to optimize police patrol routes, as this will lead to crimes prevention or to arrest the perpetrators. Accordingly, the main purpose of this study is to classify the most common objectives and problems facing the police, and the methods and models used in order to solve them. A systematic literature review is the methodology used to conduct this study, by focusing on previous studies aimed to optimize patrol routes and prevent crimes. The study relied and focused on 31 selected research papers to compare and clarify models used in crimes prediction and patrols optimization.

Meanwhile, educational technologies have been able to improve educational businesses. In fact, the creation of new concept of SMEs as the driving force of educational development, and 7PS pillars play a key role in the process of community development and educational sustainability. Due to the advancement of technologies, these companies have had one of the fastest growths in the I4.0 and in future of I4.0 (I 5.0) will have the most competition in technology and innovation with each other in the world. According to the 5th wave theory, to enter the edge of tomorrow, they need to be prepared to face tomorrow’s crises by identifying and preventing today’s challenges and future shocks. In this regard, the role of education in human resource competencies is very essential. Technical and occupational skills training, social and communication training, personal and personality competencies, conversational intelligence, and methodological and creative traits in human resources can promote sustainability in SME businesses. In fact, with constantly evolving engineering education, today a new form of SMEs (Hybrid SMEs) has emerged that considers competitive advantage not only based on the quality of knowledge-based products and services, but also their competitive advantage is the ability to change 7PS pillars changes. Hybrid SMEs/SME 5.0 seek to create acceptable organizations and markets to address specific socio-edu-cultural and environmental issues. Therefore, it is necessary to recognize and manage today’s challenges and, according to the 3D model of Socio Eco Environment SMEs, for 1-) forecasting, 2-) preventing, and 3-) facing tomorrow’s crises. The ideological principles of Tomorrow’s SMEs/SME 5.0 are based on creating value for healthy living, educational, environmental, and social justice, environmental sustainability, and superior quality products and services.","2165-9567","978-1-6654-4434-7","10.1109/EDUCON52537.2022.9766668","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9766668","Mapping the future;Tomorrow education;Edu 5.0;5th wave/tomorrow age theory or theory of comprehensive everything;Hybrid SMEs/SME 5.0;IoT-education;Cyber-learning;future concern;and educational sustainability","Solid modeling;Analytical models;Technological innovation;Three-dimensional displays;Roads;Cultural differences;Sustainable development","business continuity;educational administrative data processing;engineering education;organisational aspects;small-to-medium enterprises;socio-economic effects;strategic planning;sustainable development","competitive advantage;facing tomorrow;educational justice;environmental justice;social justice;environmental sustainability;future sustainable;business environment;economic disruptions;social, disruptions;environmental disruptions;educational business continuity;educational technologies;educational businesses;educational development;community development;educational sustainability;wave theory;future shocks;human resource competencies;communication training;personal personality competencies;human resources;SME businesses;engineering education;theory of comprehensive everything;socio eco environment","","4","","38","IEEE","11 May 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

With better image interpretation ability, image segmentation method based on deep learning can bring specific results from high-resolution imagery and is widely used in remote sensing. However, existing image segmentation methods based on semantic segmentation have difficulties to extracting refined farmland parcels. Deep neural network is used to detect farmland edge. We use high-resolution network to achieve feature extraction that retains high-resolution features, strengthens the feature representation of network context information based on object-contextual representations module, and carries out more complete interpretation of farmland and its boundary. Finally, we design a farmland edge postprocessing method to connect the disconnected boundary based on the direction information generated by the connectivity attention module, and finally obtained the farmland boundary which is complete enough to be closed for generating farmland parcels. To verify our method, we used Google Earth image to label farmland boundaries and conduct experimental verification. The results show that our proposed model has a higher precision for farmland edge detection, and the postprocessing method of boundary connection can effectively close the boundary lines and achieve more detailed and complete farmland parcels.","2151-1535","","10.1109/JSTARS.2023.3253779","National Key R&D Program of China(grant numbers:2022YFB3903402); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:42222106); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61976234); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10061546","Deep learning;edge detection;farmland extraction;fully convolutional networks;semantic segmentation","Feature extraction;Image edge detection;Image resolution;Semantics;Semantic segmentation;Data mining;Remote sensing","agriculture;crops;deep learning (artificial intelligence);edge detection;feature extraction;geophysical image processing;image representation;image resolution;image segmentation;object detection;remote sensing;sustainable development","boundary connection;connectivity attention module;deep learning;deep neural network;direction guided postprocessing;disconnected boundary;dynamic crop detection;Earth observation;farmland boundary;farmland edge detection;farmland edge postprocessing method;farmland information;farmland parcel extraction;feature extraction;feature representation;Google Earth image;high-resolution features;high-resolution network;high-resolution remote sensing imagery;image interpretation ability;image segmentation;network context information;object-contextual representations module;semantic segmentation;sustainable land development","","","","61","CCBY","7 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We first devise heuristic rules to identify home/work purposes. Then, a flexible latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) model is presented to discover the activities for remaining trips, in which each trip is depicted by four attributes, i.e. arrival time, age group, stay duration, and the point of interest tag for the destination. Experimental results show that the proposed method can identify diverse trip purposes by explaining their structures over trip attributes and outperform baselines in terms of log-likelihood and perplexity. We also analyze the difference between the automatically discovered trip purposes and those estimated from household census, and the analyzed results demonstrate the feasibility of our proposed method.","1558-0016","","10.1109/TITS.2021.3121551","National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2020YFB2104001); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:U1811463,61903363,61876011,61603381); Chinese Guangdong’s Science and Technology Project(grant numbers:2019B1515120030); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9585430","Trip purpose inference;cellular network data;latent Dirichlet allocation;travel behavior;big data","Cellular networks;Trajectory;Semantics;Unsupervised learning;Supervised learning;Resource management;Public transportation","behavioural sciences computing;cellular radio;data mining;mobile computing;mobile handsets;natural language processing;telecommunication signalling;travel industry","household census;point of interest tag;LDA model;heuristic rules;large-scale cellular network data handling;methodological framework;trip purposes mining;trip attributes;diverse trip purposes;flexible latent Dirichlet allocation model;semantic details;fine-grained information;mobile cellular signaling;detail records;travel behaviors;human mobility;mobile phones;mobile signaling data","","","","57","IEEE","26 Oct 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This process greatly impacted the daily activities of the hospitals. In this paper, we propose a two-step approach based on process mining and discrete-event simulation for sizing a recovery unit dedicated to COVID-19 patients inside a hospital. A decision aid framework is proposed to help hospital managers make crucial decisions, such as hospitalization cancellation and resource sizing, taking into account all units of the hospital. Three sources of patients are considered: (i) planned admissions, (ii) emergent admissions representing day-to-day activities, and (iii) COVID-19 admissions. Hospitalization pathways have been modeled using process mining based on synthetic medico-administrative data, and a generic model of bed transfers between units is proposed as a basis to evaluate the impact of those moves using discrete-event simulation. A practical case study in collaboration with a local hospital is presented to assess the robustness of the approach. Note to Practitioners—In this paper we develop and test a new decision-aid tool dedicated to bed management, taking into account exceptional hospitalization pathways such as COVID-19 patients. The tool enables the creation of a dedicated COVID-19 intensive care unit with specific management rules that are fine-tuned by considering the characteristics of the pandemic. Health practitioners can automatically use medico-administrative data extracted from the information system of the hospital to feed the model. Two execution modes are proposed: (i) fine-tuning of the staffed beds assignment policies through a design of experiment and (ii) simulation of user-defined scenarios. A practical case study in collaboration with a local hospital is presented. The results show that our model was able to find the strategy to minimize the number of transfers and the number of cancellations while maximizing the number of COVID-19 patients taken into care was to transfer beds to the COVID-19 ICU in batches of 12 and to cancel appointed patients using ICU when the department hit a 90% occupation rate.","1558-3783","","10.1109/TASE.2023.3274847","“Agence Nationale de la Recherche”, which funded the thesis on the study of multimorbid pathways(grant numbers:ANR-18-CE19-0016); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10129157","Discrete event simulation;healthcare applications;process mining","Hospitals;COVID-19;Data models;Pandemics;Surgery;Data mining;Surges","","","","","","","IEEE","18 May 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

Right when an estimate model has been fabricated, it is challenging to restrict it for the motivations driving the advertiser, to pick the very thing displaying moves to make for every client or for the party of clients. Notwithstanding the multifaceted nature of this arrangement, most client models are completely fundamental. As the need might arise, most client conduct investigation models ignore such endless proper factors that the gauges they make are overall not altogether strong. This paper plans to encourage a connection rule mining model to expect client conduct using a typical electronic retail store for data combination and concentrate critical examples from the client conduct data. In this undertaking, a solo grouping of information on the customer's records from a regular food item company's data set will be played out.

This raised the need to investigate opportunities that reduced O&S costs, which spanned the spectrum from technology-enabled maintenance operations to autonomy and analytics. VirtualWorx™ focused on the former and in particular, the process of flying technicians to international field sites to solve challenging troubleshooting and repair issues that were beyond the capabilities of the local maintainers but would have broader implications affecting product maintainability.The opportunity focused on business process improvement through the insertion of technology to better leverage global human resources and extend the significant breadth and depth of engineering expertise from Raytheon Centers of Excellence. This would allow support of deployed systems anywhere in the world through secure two-way audio & video communication up to and including augmented reality-based interactive remote collaboration. Figure 1 depicts the brainstorming session that resulted in a ""back-of-the-napkin"" design.The vision was to provide a secure enterprise, technical collaboration solution by implementing augmented reality-based communication capability to improve operational availability (Ao) of a system to perform its mission, reduce overall sustainment costs (including significant reduction in program travel), and provide effective troubleshooting of systems under repair.The proposed strategy prioritized customer driven use cases and network architecture development to:•Establish scalable Outside Contiguous United State (OCONUS) reach-back connectivity for technical support between a remote user and subject matter expert over a secure infrastructure worldwide•Facilitate technical support via a common environment using Augmented Reality (AR) capabilities over existing company network infrastructure•Enable the spectrum of collaboration across the enterprise to reduce staffing costs, leverage technical expertise, and provide improved Efficiency, Effectiveness, Capacity, and Capability (E2C2).With a strong business case, a successful proof-of-concept phase gained support from senior leadership in engineering and digital technology and earned further investment through Raytheon Independent Research and Development (IRAD) funding to move the project forward into a pilot phase for the first use case - remotely supported maintenance.To date, VirtualWorx™ has been successfully piloted and deployed on various internal and customer programs handling a variety of data and communication-rich exchanges that span the entire development life cycle.Underneath the system’s hardware and Raytheon Technologies’ global network infrastructure, VirtualWorx™ is powered by Librestream’s Onsite software platform that provides responsive technical support throughout the product life cycle allowing the emerging workforce to respond in a way employees feel most comfortable—via video.VirtualWorx™ has become a Raytheon Technologies Enterprise solution for end-to-end augmented reality collaboration specifically tailored to support remote maintenance of aerospace and defense repairable assets. The on-premises solution carries export controlled technical data and delivers live reach-back support over an increasing variety of use cases since the initial proof-of-concept—to support maintenance and repair of deployed systems around the world. It streams AR-enhanced live audio & video between field service engineers, subject matter experts, domestic and international business partners and is accessible anywhere on the company’s global network and through virtual private networking (VPN) access from off-site locations.Return on investment (ROI) has been realized from the initial remote maintenance use case to broader applications of the technology to resolve both internal and external challenges. Many of these recent challenges were especially brought on by recent COVID pandemic conditions that restricted global travel, limited face-to-face communication, and prevented movement of personnel as sites were locked-down due to COVID exposure concerns.","2577-0993","978-1-6654-6053-8","10.1109/RAMS51473.2023.10088179","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10088179","Advanced Visualization;Augmented Reality Remote Collaboration;Technical Support;Operations & Sustainment","COVID-19;Costs;Collaboration;Maintenance engineering;Streaming media;Software;Virtual private networks","augmented reality;groupware;human resource management;maintenance engineering;personnel;six sigma (quality);video communication;virtual private networks","2015 Raytheon six sigma process improvement project;AR;augmented reality collaboration capabilities;augmented reality-based communication capability;augmented reality-based interactive remote collaboration;back-of-the-napkin design;business process improvement;company network infrastructure;domestic business partners;E2C2;end-to-end augmented reality collaboration;engineering expertise;export controlled technical data;field service engineers;global human resources;global network infrastructure;international business partners;international field sites;maintenance concepts transformation;network architecture development;OCONUS;outside contiguous United State reach-back connectivity;proof-of-concept phase gained support;Raytheon technologies enterprise solution;remote user;ROI;technical collaboration solution;technology-enabled maintenance operations;video communication;virtual private networking access;VirtualWorx™;VPN","","","","3","IEEE","5 Apr 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Beyond the real-time status update, utilizing vast IoT data and creating machine learning and optimization models provide us with intelligent business recommendations. Those are used by the site engineers and managers to make real-time decisions in a situation with multiple conflicting operational and business goals. Those goals include maximizing financial gain, minimizing costs, limiting the usage of certain raw materials or additives, decreasing environmental impact, and more. When formalizing these decision-making tasks, often there is no prior knowledge of compromise between the conflicting goals. That poses a challenge to generate a proper objective function. In this paper, we create a Multi-Step optimization process to address this uncertainty of selecting proper objectives and their preferences. Instead of using an explicit trade-off to create a single weighted objective function (as a traditional approach) and rely on a single attempt to find the optimal solution, we decompose this problem into multiple steps. In each step, we optimize only one objective from one KPI with an exact semantic meaning. We demonstrate the usability of the approach using a practical application from an oil sands processing facility, provide modeling results focusing on the response to business priorities, performance, and interpretability. The multi-step approach presents the convergence of the target goal with an outcome KPI with comparison for each step to illustrate the enhanced interpretability.","","978-1-6654-4431-6","10.1109/WF-IoT51360.2021.9595035","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9595035","Interpretability;optimization;production optimization;multistage production;multi-step optimization;optimization with sensor data;Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP)","Uncertainty;Semantics;Linear programming;Real-time systems;Raw materials;Internet of Things;Usability","decision making;deep learning (artificial intelligence);industrial plants;Internet of Things;manufacturing processes;optimisation;production engineering computing;sensor placement","oil sands processing facility;semantic meaning;KPI;multistep production optimization;decision making;raw materials;intelligent business recommendations;machine learning;IoT sensor data;real-time status update;real-time onsite management;industrial manufacturing process;optimal solution;single weighted objective function","","","","19","IEEE","9 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Blockchain provides a secure and scalable data management framework for IoT devices. However, the huge computation and energy cost of the consensus process in blockchain prevents it from being directly applied as a generic platform. To overcome this challenge, in this article, we propose a cloud mining pool-aided BCoT architecture, where the IoT devices can rent the computing resources from the cloud mining pools to offload the mining process. Based on this architecture, we study the mining pool selection problem and analyze the colony behaviors of IoT devices with different pooling strategies.

Meanwhile, with the development of IOV (Internet of Vehicles) technology, various delay-sensitive and compute-intensive in-vehicle applications continue to appear. Compared with traditional Internet business, these computation tasks have higher processing priority and lower delay requirements.

In view of the problem, a deep reinforcement learning-based joint computation offloading and task migration optimization (JCOTM) algorithm is proposed, considering the influences of multiple factors such as concurrent multiple computation tasks, system computing resources distribution, and network communication bandwidth. And, the mixed integer nonlinear programming problem is described as a Markov Decision Process.

For this reason, we formulate the top- $k$  FPM problem in large geo-social networks. Specifically, we devise a novel framework for subgraph retrieval and FPM mining with a series of optimizations. First, we propose a neighboring-aware R-tree (NaR-Tree) index structure to alleviate the challenge of retrieving subgraphs from a large graph. NaR-Tree is a variant of R-tree in which each nonleaf tree node further maintains some edge statistics information for the rectangle related to it. Second, we define the concept of minimum image-based support of edges (MNIE). With the help of the NaR-Tree and MNIE-based pattern extension approach, a mining algorithm that addresses the problem of exponential candidate patterns is proposed. We also present a lazy retrieval strategy to reduce the frequency of subgraph retrieval. Finally, we adopt an edge sampling approach to further accelerate the mining process.

So, implementing an efficient and effective relief supply distribution system to save human lives is of vital importance. To this end, we introduce a model to deal with two interdependent problems: vehicle routing problem (VRP) as well as relief distribution scheduling among demand points regarding three objective functions: First objective function is minimizing operational costs which include fixed and variable costs of using available heterogeneous fleet according to the designated route. Also, for more proper modeling of reality in the complex decision space of the response phase, two qualitative objective functions are introduced in this study: the importance of unmet demand and the importance of late-satisfied demand. For evaluating introduced qualitative indexes, we employ Fuzzy Inference Systems (FISs) to encapsulate decision makers' knowledge and human reasoning process. To solve the proposed model, FISs were embedded in Non-Dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II) and non-dominated ranked genetic algorithm (NRGA). Then algorithms were implemented on two categories of problems with small and large sizes and the performances of the algorithms were compared based on four criteria. The results of statistical tests showed that both algorithms have the same performance in small-size problems. However, NSGA-II outperforms NRGA in terms of runtime in large cases. As the objective functions are constructed based on FISs, the model can be adapted to various situations just by defining linguistic rules in the way that humans think and reason. Also, since the output of the algorithm is a trade-off among the objective functions in the form of Pareto optimal solutions, decision-makers can choose the best appropriate solution according to the circumstances.","","978-1-6654-9713-8","10.1109/ICTIS54573.2021.9798556","European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation program(grant numbers:823759); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9798556","Decision Support Systems;Humanitarian logistics;Multi-objective optimization;Vehicle routing problem (VRP);Relief distribution;Genetic Algorithm (GA);Fuzzy inference system (FIS);Natural disasters;Resource allocation","Fuzzy logic;Costs;Runtime;Vehicle routing;Transportation;Linear programming;Inference algorithms","disasters;emergency management;fuzzy reasoning;genetic algorithms;Pareto optimisation","FISs;objective function;multiobjective optimization model;fuzzy inference systems;NSGA-II;NRGA;natural disasters;vehicle routing problem;relief distribution scheduling;qualitative objective functions;human reasoning process;nondominated sorting genetic algorithm II;relief supply distribution system;Pareto optimal solution","","","","41","IEEE","27 Jun 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Mining temporal motifs is a fundamental problem used in several application domains. However, existing software frameworks offer suboptimal performance due to high algorithmic complexity and irregular memory accesses of temporal motif mining.This paper presents $\mathsf{Mint}$—a novel accelerator architecture and a programming model for mining temporal motifs efficiently. We first divide this workload into three fundamental tasks: search, book-keeping, and backtracking. Based on this, we propose a task-centric programming model that enables decoupled, asynchronous execution. This model unlocks massive opportunities for parallelism, and allows storing task context information on-chip. To best utilize the proposed programming model, we design a domain-specific hardware accelerator using its data path and memory subsystem design to cater to the unique workload characteristics of temporal motif mining. To further improve performance, we propose a novel optimization called search index memoization that significantly reduces memory traffic. We comprehensively compare the performance of $\mathsf{Mint}$ with state-of-the-art temporal motif mining software frameworks (both approximate and exact) running on both CPU and GPU, and show $9\times-2576\times$ benefit in performance.","","978-1-6654-6272-3","10.1109/MICRO56248.2022.00089","Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9923899","hardware accelerator;programming model;temporal motif mining","Software algorithms;Programming;Parallel processing;Software;Data models;System-on-chip;Data mining","data mining;embedded systems;graph theory;information retrieval;multiprocessing systems;optimisation;parallel programming;program compilers","state-of-the-art temporal motif mining software frameworks;mining temporal motifs;temporal graphs;static graphs;edge ordering;graph structure;task-centric programming model","","","","80","IEEE","26 Oct 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, such generic aesthetics models neglect the fact that users’ aesthetic preferences vary significantly depending on their unique preferences. Therefore, it is essential to tackle the issue for personalized IAA (PIAA). Since PIAA is a typical small sample learning (SSL) problem, existing PIAA models are usually built by fine-tuning the well-established generic IAA (GIAA) models, which are regarded as prior knowledge. Nevertheless, this kind of prior knowledge based on “average aesthetics” fails to incarnate the aesthetic diversity of different people. In order to learn the shared prior knowledge when different people judge aesthetics, that is, learn how people judge image aesthetics, we propose a PIAA method based on meta-learning with bilevel gradient optimization (BLG-PIAA), which is trained using individual aesthetic data directly and generalizes to unknown users quickly. The proposed approach consists of two phases: 1) meta-training and 2) meta-testing. In meta-training, the aesthetics assessment of each user is regarded as a task, and the training set of each task is divided into two sets: 1) support set and 2) query set. Unlike traditional methods that train a GIAA model based on average aesthetics, we train an aesthetic meta-learner model by bilevel gradient updating from the support set to the query set using many users’ PIAA tasks. In meta-testing, the aesthetic meta-learner model is fine-tuned using a small amount of aesthetic data of a target user to obtain the PIAA model. The experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art PIAA metrics, and the learned prior model of BLG-PIAA can be quickly adapted to unseen PIAA tasks.","2168-2275","","10.1109/TCYB.2020.2984670","Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province(grant numbers:BK20181354); Science and Technology Plan of Xi’an(grant numbers:20191122015KYPT011JC013); Postgraduate Research and Practice Innovation Program of Jiangsu Province(grant numbers:KYCX19_2142); Postgraduate Research and Practice Innovation Program of China University of Mining and Technology(grant numbers:KYCX19_2142); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61771473,61991451,61379143); Six Talent Peaks High-Level Talents in Jiangsu Province(grant numbers:XYDXX-063); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9115059","Bilevel gradient optimization;meta-learning;personalized image aesthetics assessment (PIAA);small sample learning (SSL)","Task analysis;Adaptation models;Optimization;Visualization;Integrated circuit modeling;Training","generalisation (artificial intelligence);gradient methods;image processing;learning (artificial intelligence);optimisation;query processing","aesthetic meta-learner model;BLG-PIAA;personalized image aesthetics assessment;meta-learning;bilevel gradient optimization;aesthetics model;average aesthetics;aesthetic diversity;meta-training;GIAA model;meta-testing;aesthetic data;prior knowledge sharing;small sample learning problem;PIAA metrics;generalization;support set;query set","Esthetics;Humans;Learning","11","","55","IEEE","11 Jun 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Using graphs to represent relationships between entities provides enriched models for emerging tasks of web search and information retrieval. Natural language processing algorithms use graphs to model structural relationships of texts efficiently, resulting in improved performance. However, the need to increase the accuracy of graph construction and weight allocation remains a fundamental challenge. Existing methods for these tasks provide limited efficiency and lack scalability for large graphs. In this study, we propose a novel graph-based method for text modeling and running a query to evaluate the similarity of text segments. In this method, the graph corresponding to the text is first created by modeling words and named entities by the state-of-the-art pre-trained BERT model. Graph nodes are then weighted in two stages. In the first stage, the nodes with more generalization obtain higher weights. The second weighting stage is done by the graph obtained from the query text. In this weighting step, nodes are considered important if they are specifically related to the query text. After determining the important nodes in the graph, the semantic similarity between the query text and the texts in the database is measured. The whole process of this framework uses a natural language processing pipeline in Apache Spark scalable platform. The efficiency of the model was evaluated for both distributed and non-distributed configuration and its scalability on a Spark cluster. Evaluation of the accuracy using the Pearson correlation coefficient shows that the proposed method performs higher performance than its competitors.","","978-1-6654-0426-6","10.1109/ICWR51868.2021.9443144","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9443144","Graph Database;Semantic Similarity;Apache Spark;Unsupervised Learning;BERT;Selective Weighting;Distributed Algorithm","Text mining;Databases;Scalability;Semantics;Web mining;Natural language processing;Sparks","data mining;graph theory;information retrieval;natural language processing;query processing;text analysis","graph nodes;weighting stage;query text;natural language processing pipeline;scalable similarity evaluation;text graphs;graph databases;text mining;web mining;enriched models;web search;information retrieval;natural language processing algorithms;model structural relationships;graph construction;weight allocation;novel graph-based method;text modeling;text segments;modeling words;state-of-the-art pre-trained BERT model","","","","31","IEEE","2 Jun 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The methodology is as follows. First, the data is cleaned using rules from domain knowledge. Second, similar features between the two databases were evaluated by applying correlation technique. Finally, we developed a rule-based engine to merge existing failure datasets into one main database. Our rule-based engine was calibrated according to the distribution of the observed distance between similar features. At first, we were able to match the failure data by 65%, then we enhanced our algorithm using Natural Language Processing (NLP) technique and we were able to reach an outstanding score of 85%. Traditionally this data alignment is done yearly by human experts. This is an extremely time-consuming task, and our automatic matching algorithm reduces workload by 70% and biases in life-cycle data analysis. With a confidence level our algorithm interactively suggests matches according to their distances.","2577-0993","978-1-6654-2432-5","10.1109/RAMS51457.2022.9893932","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9893932","data alignment;life data analysis;natural language processing;decision trees;data quality;machine learning","Industries;Data analysis;Databases;Data integrity;Random access memory;Natural language processing;Enterprise resource planning","data analysis;data mining;database management systems;enterprise resource planning;failure analysis;image matching;knowledge based systems;natural language processing","rule-based engine;data alignment;automatic matching algorithm;life-cycle data analysis;automatic database alignment method;failure data quality;coherent failure data;Enterprise Resource Planning databases;inconsistent failure data analysis;existing failure datasets;main database;valuable analysis","","1","","12","IEEE","20 Sep 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This approach drastically limits the performance of those models on real-world data such as electronic health record documents. This work introduces a fine-grained language model trained over a SentencePiece tokenizer with various biomedical and clinical data. Through this RoBERTa-based model, referred to as BioBERTa, we demonstrated the importance of data-dependant optimization by evaluating our model on several Named Entity Recognition tasks. Our approach showed state-of-the-art results on NCBI-disease and BC5-disease datasets. We demonstrated the effectiveness of an in-domain tokenizer where ours improved the embedding length by 15.1% of its original model.

Federated learning in multi-tier computing can integrate the resources of the device-edge-fog-cloud layer to interact and cooperate. For example, in addition to offloading training locally, the tasks of the device layer can also be uploaded to the edge layer or the fog layer for training, while the global aggregation node can be selected at the edge or fog or cloud. However, due to the uncertainty of network bandwidth, computing resources and terminal training tasks at each layer, it brings challenges to resource allocation and task offloading under federated learning in multi-tier computing. Therefore, we propose a TD3-based algorithm which aims to solve how to select training nodes and aggregation nodes during joint training on multi-tier federated learning to minimize the average task delay.

To enhance the exploration ability of agent and simultaneously ensure the stability of parameter learning, we proposed a novel proximal parameter distribution optimization (PPDO) algorithm. On the one hand, PPDO enhances the exploration ability of RL agent by transforming NN parameter from a certain single value to a function distribution. On the other hand, PPDO accelerates the parameter distribution optimization by setting two groups of parameters. The parameter optimization is guided by evaluating the parameter quality change before and after the parameter distribution update. In addition, PPDO reduces the influence of bias and variance on the value function approximation by limiting the amplitude of the two consecutive parameter updates, which can enhance the stability of the parameter distribution optimization. Experiments on the OpenAI Gym, Atari, and MuJoCo platforms indicate that PPDO can improve the exploration ability and learning efficiency of deep RL algorithms, including DQN and A3C.","2168-2232","","10.1109/TSMC.2019.2931946","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61976215,61772532); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8820176","Exploration;optimization;parameter distribution;reinforcement learning (RL)","Optimization;Task analysis;Artificial neural networks;Noise measurement;Uncertainty;Reinforcement learning;Acceleration","function approximation;learning (artificial intelligence);multi-agent systems;optimisation","reinforcement learning;neural network parameters;additional intrinsic motivation term;RL agent;optimal policy;learning process;exploration ability;parameter learning;PPDO;NN parameter;function distribution;parameter optimization;parameter quality change;parameter distribution update;consecutive parameter updates;learning efficiency;deep RL algorithms;proximal parameter distribution optimization algorithm","","4","","41","IEEE","30 Aug 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Second, the resource allocation layer, where the Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) algorithm is used to determine the computing platform again when the task is determined to be offloaded to either MEC servers or the cloud servers. To evaluate the performance of the RF classifier, we applied the model to a real-world driving trajectory dataset, and then compared the results with a different set of Machine Learning (ML) algorithms namely, K-nearest neighbour (KNN), Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) and Support Vector Machine (SVM). The results show the RF model outperformed other models in classification accuracy score of 99.83% for task offloading decision, where the KNN, MLP and SVM achieved 9S%, 94.Sl% and 90.94%, respectively.

But before referring expression generation, collaborative robots must determine the content and structure of a sequence of utterances, a task known as document planning in the natural language generation community. This problem presents additional challenges for robots in situated contexts, where described objects change both physically and in the minds of their interlocutors. In this work, we consider how robots can “think ahead” about the objects they must refer to and how to refer to them, sequencing object references to form a coherent, easy to follow chain. Specifically, we leverage GH to enable robots to plan their utterances in a way that keeps objects at a high cognitive status, which enables use of concise, anaphoric referring forms. We encode these linguistic insights as a mixed integer program within a planning context, formulating constraints to concisely and efficiently capture GH-theoretic cognitive properties. We demonstrate that this GH-informed planner generates sequences of utterances with high intersentential coherence, which we argue should enable substantially more efficient and natural human-robot dialogue.","2153-0866","978-1-6654-7927-1","10.1109/IROS47612.2022.9981811","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9981811","","Sequential analysis;Collaboration;Human-robot interaction;Linguistics;Encoding;Planning;Task analysis","computational linguistics;human-robot interaction;interactive systems;linguistics;natural language processing","anaphoric referring forms;collaborative robots;GH-informed planner;GH-theoretic cognitive properties;Givenness Hierarchy informed optimal document planning;human-robot dialogue;interlocutors;linguistic theory;mixed integer program;natural language generation community;planning context;situated human-robot interaction","","","","40","IEEE","26 Dec 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this work, to remove the slowdowns in performance on multimodal tasks, we decouple the learning procedures of unimodal and multimodal networks by dynamically balancing the learning rates for various modalities, so that the modality-specific optimization algorithm for each modality can be obtained. Specifically, the adaptive tracking factor (ATF) is introduced to adjust the learning rate for each modality on a real-time basis. Furthermore, adaptive convergent equalization (ACE) and bilevel directional optimization (BDO) are proposed to equalize and update the ATF, avoiding sub-optimal unimodal representations due to overfitting or underfitting.

Also, using human judgements or “eye-balling” techniques, it was able to evaluate that the topic distribution generated by both the LDA and BERTopic model was able to capture the information needed by the organization.","","979-8-3503-3390-9","10.1109/iCORE58172.2022.00020","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10071685","Topic Modeling;Natural Language Processing;Machine Learning;LDA;BERTopic","Analytical models;Computational modeling;Coherence;Organizations;Data models;Resource management;Data mining","customer services;natural language processing;text analysis","base LDA model;BERTopic;coherence score;cohesion score;Customer Feedback;fine-tuned LDA model;fine-tuning;Latent Dirichlet Allocation;multilingual model;Online Ticketing System;relevant Tagalog words;topic distribution;Topic Modeling","","","","16","IEEE","28 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A hashtag is a metadata tag used to classify data into a category. However, there has been little discussion on segmenting hashtags so far. We propose an algorithm to segment hashtags by optimizing computation time. We create candidates according to a given corpus, containing 1-gram (unigram) and 2-gram (bigram) data. The proposed algorithm allows a reduction in the computation time of generating segments by limiting the candidates in a given corpus. The fewer candidates there are, the shorter the calculation is, leading to a decreased duration. In this study, we gather food-related unstructured tweets (N = 951,255) from Twitter. Our results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm allows a computation time reduction of 29.7%. However, if the segment could not be found with the proposed algorithm, the original method for hashtag segmentation, which includes identifying all possible candidates, is used as a fallback method. The proposed approach improves the hashtag segmentation technique, minimizing computation time, which could be utilized in real-time tweet analysis. The result of our study shows that the trend of sentiments for both raw data and segmented data is similar, which also verifies the method's accuracy. This study's discoveries uncover that, despite the fact that computers are getting faster, computational resources should be utilized effectively. Our work also provides a data collection model for future surveys, which could also shorten the data retrieval process with multi-threading programming concepts.","1558-2612","978-1-7281-9505-6","10.1109/WCNC49053.2021.9417569","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9417569","Hashtag segmentation;computation time optimization;Twitter;social media data;tweets;data analysis","Computers;Limiting;Social networking (online);Text recognition;Programming;Market research;Computational efficiency","data mining;image segmentation;meta data;multi-threading;natural language processing;pattern classification;social networking (online);text analysis","computation time optimization;social media data;sentiment analysis;segmenting;given corpus;fewer candidates;food-related unstructured tweets;computation time reduction;possible candidates;hashtag segmentation technique;real-time tweet analysis;raw data;segmented data;computational resources;data collection model;data retrieval process","","","","11","IEEE","5 May 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

When applying the semantic segmentation models to large-scale or unseen scenarios, a so-called ""domain shift"" generally exists between the source and the target domain, where we train and evaluate our models. To mitigate such a problem, domain adaptation leverages the unlabeled data in the target domain to align or fine tuned the model using the target statistics. In previous domain adaptation approaches based on self-training, only the output-level knowledge (e.g., pseudo labels) from the source model is used to guide the adaptation process. However, we notice that the ""pseudo features"" generated by the source model could be of greater potential for capturing the relationship between target domain samples. To this end, we seek to exploit feature-level relation among neighboring pixels in the target domain to structure the prediction of the domain adaptation model. Experiments on public ISPRS datasets verify that the proposed method can outperform previous unsupervised domain adaptation methods, and demonstrate the benefits of mining local feature relation.","2642-9535","978-1-6654-9373-4","10.1109/JURSE57346.2023.10144219","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10144219","semantic segmentation;domain adaptation;aerial images;self-training","Adaptation models;Semantic segmentation;Urban planning;Semantics;Data models;Task analysis;Remote sensing","data mining;feature extraction;geophysical image processing;image classification;image segmentation;unsupervised learning","adaptation process;domain adaptation leverages;domain adaptation model;domain adaptive semantic segmentation;domain shift;feature-level relation;fundamental task;previous domain adaptation approaches;previous unsupervised domain adaptation methods;pseudofeatures guided self-training;pseudolabels;semantic segmentation models;source model;target domain samples;target statistics;urban management;urban planning;urban scenes","","","","13","IEEE","8 Jun 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Transformation is a constantly evolving process where Robotic Process Automation or RPA came into the process of renovation. RPA has recently become a valuable tool in banking and financial institutions. RPA has shown a lot of various benefits for different organizations. The primary intention of Robotic Process Automation in banking is to reduce repetitive tasks in the bank. In banking and various other organizations, RPA has helped reduce the operational costs by 30% - 70%; RPA helps reduce the workforce by employing Bot workers in charge, which later saves the operating costs and increases efficiency and accuracy of the tasks. Lenders are regularly facing pressure to reduce the prices as well as to reduce and save time. Lender hence switches into automation for better efficiency and accuracy of service. With automation bots, lenders can automate loan processing by collecting customer information, loan approval, loan monitoring, and automatic loan pricing. This can be achieved with the help of rule-based software bots. Also, many of the lenders do some part of the process partially automated and some part manually. Banks and financial institutions are switching to automation and training to stay on top of the latest security developments. This helps to keep an eye on the evolving trends in the payment space. Fraud for instance, is an ongoing threat. All major finance domain are looking forward to implement the concept of RPA technologies. Which help in preventing the possible frauds and also helps in mitigating the other human errors. The paper talks about how RPA can mitigate fraud risks through various methods such as reassessing current processes, eliminating human errors, enhanced trade monitoring, automated threat detection, and searching for anomalies and much more.","","978-1-6654-1703-7","10.1109/ICRITO51393.2021.9596076","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9596076","Automation;Robotic Process Automation (RPA);Banking Sector;Loan Processing;Fraud Detection;Digital Transformation","Training;Bot (Internet);Costs;Banking;Organizations;Switches;Tools","bank data processing;fraud;pricing;security of data;software agents","robotic process automation;banking;loan processing;operational cost reduction;lender;automation bots;automatic loan pricing;financial institutions;RPA technologies;automated threat detection;fraud detection;rule-based software bots","","10","","49","IEEE","15 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To cater to the dynamic service requirements of these verticals and meet the required quality-of-service (QoS) mentioned in the service-level agreement (SLA), network slices need to be isolated through dedicated elements and resources. Additionally, allocated resources to these slices need to be continuously monitored and intelligently managed. This enables immediate detection and correction of any SLA violation to support automated service assurance in a closed-loop fashion. By reducing human intervention, intelligent and closed-loop resource management reduces the cost of offering flexible services. Resource management in a network shared among verticals (potentially administered by different providers), would be further facilitated through open and standardized interfaces. Open radio access network (O-RAN) is perhaps the most promising RAN architecture that inherits all the aforementioned features, namely intelligence, open and standard interfaces, and closed control loop. Inspired by this, in this article we provide closed loop and intelligent resource provisioning scheme for O-RAN slicing to prevent SLA violations. In order to maintain realism, a real-world dataset of a large operator is used to train a learning solution for optimizing resource utilization in the proposed closed-loop service automation process. Moreover, the deployment architecture and the corresponding flow that are cognizant of the O-RAN requirements are also discussed.","2471-2833","","10.1109/MCOMSTD.0001.2200017","NSF(grant numbers:CNS-1564148,CNS-1814477); Oak Ridge National Laboratory(grant numbers:4000170832); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9927252","","Automation;Costs;Network slicing;Quality of service;Dynamic scheduling;Resource management;Closed loop systems;Predictive models","closed loop systems;quality of service;radio access networks;resource allocation;telecommunication network management","agile network deployment;allocated resources;automated service assurance;closed-loop fashion;closed-loop resource management;closed-loop service automation process;control loop;customized network deployment;different service types;dynamic service requirements;flexible services;human intervention;immediate detection;intelligent resource provisioning scheme;network slicing;O-RAN based network slicing;O-RAN requirements;O-RAN slicing;open interfaces;open radio access network;optimizing resource utilization;predictive closed-loop service automation;promising RAN architecture;quality-of-service;resource utilization;service-level agreement;SLA violation;standard interfaces;standardized interfaces","","2","","15","IEEE","21 Oct 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

Due to diverse factors (i.e., task difficulty, worker capability, and incentives), the collected answers from various crowd workers are of different quality. Many approaches have been proposed to manage high quality answers and to reduce the budget by modelling tasks, workers, or both. However, most of the existing approaches implicitly assume that the capability of workers is fixed during the crowdsourcing process. But in practice, such capability can be improved by gradually completing easy to hard tasks, alike human beings’ intrinsic self-paced learning ability. In this paper, we investigate crowdsourcing with self-paced workers, whose capability can be gradually boosted as he/she scrutinises and completes easy to hard tasks. Our proposed SPCrowd (Self-Paced Crowd worker) first asks workers to complete a set of golden tasks with known annotations; provides feedback to assist workers with capturing the raw modes of tasks and to spark the self-paced learning, which in turn facilitates the estimation of workers’ quality and tasks’ difficulty. It then introduces a task difficulty model to quantify the difficulty of tasks and rank them from easy to hard, and a benefit maximization criterion for task assignment, which can dynamically monitor the quality of self-paced workers and assign the sorted tasks to capable workers. In this way, a worker can successfully complete hard tasks after he/she completes easier and related tasks. Experimental results on semi-simulated and real crowdsourcing projects show that SPCrowd can better control the quality and save the budget compared to competitive baselines.","2374-8486","978-1-6654-2398-4","10.1109/ICDM51629.2021.00038","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9679043","Crowdsourcing;Self-paced learning;Quality control;Task assignment;Truth inference","Crowdsourcing;Costs;Uncertainty;Annotations;Human intelligence;Estimation;Sparks","computer aided instruction;evolutionary computation;human computer interaction;learning (artificial intelligence);mobile computing;optimisation;personnel;statistical analysis","self-paced workers;computer-hard tasks;worker capability;crowd workers;high quality answers;modelling tasks;crowdsourcing process;Self-Paced Crowd worker;golden tasks;task difficulty model;task assignment;sorted tasks;capable workers","","2","","36","IEEE","24 Jan 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this article, a video surveillance system with augmented intelligence of things is considered as a promising solution to enhance the operational efficiency of enterprises. However, the challenge is to process the surveillance video streams as soon as possible without ignoring any emergencies. This issue can be formulated as a two-stage scheduling problem, which is an NP-hard problem that can be integrated with higher level enterprise systems for operational efficiency improvement. An improved Deep Q-Network (DQN) model with a newly designed prioritized replay scheme, named Bi-Dueling DQN with Prioritized Replay, is proposed to solve this two-stage scheduling problem in a smart enterprise management system. A dense reward function based on a concrete state representation is designed to tackle the sparse reward challenge and to speed up the convergence in actual large-scale task scheduling process. A prioritized replay scheme is then developed to improve the sampling efficiency, so as to effectively reduce the training time in deep reinforcement learning for the optimal two-stage scheduling. The experiment results demonstrated that the proposed approach is able to provide an efficient scheduling policy to resolve the two-stage scheduling problem, while at the same time offering insight information to improve the performance of higher level smart enterprise management systems.","1941-0050","","10.1109/TII.2022.3216295","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:72091313,72091515,62072171); Key R&D Program of Hunan Province of China(grant numbers:2020SK2089); Open Fund of Key Laboratory of Hunan Province(grant numbers:2017TP1026); Hunan Provincial Innovation Foundation for Postgraduate(grant numbers:CX20211102); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9931428","Augmented intelligence;deep reinforcement learning (DRL);dueling Deep Q-Network (DQN);enterprise management systems (EMS);prioritized replay;two-stage scheduling","Job shop scheduling;Scheduling;Task analysis;Processor scheduling;Streaming media;Servers;Video surveillance","","","","","","36","IEEE","27 Oct 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The application of association rule mining in healthcare data has been widespread to this point in time. Most applications focus on positive association rules, ignoring the negative consequences of particular diagnostic techniques. When it comes to bridging divergent diseases and drugs, negative association rules may give more helpful information than positive ones. This is especially true when it comes to physicians and social organizations (e.g., a certain symptom will not arise when certain symptoms exist). Data mining in healthcare must be done in a way that protects the identity of patients, especially when dealing with sensitive information. However, revealing this information puts it at risk of attack. Healthcare data privacy protection has lately been addressed by technologies that disrupt data (data sanitization) and reconstruct aggregate distributions in the interest of doing research in data mining. In this study, metaheuristic-based data sanitization for healthcare data mining is investigated in order to keep patient privacy protected. It is hoped that by using the Tabu-genetic algorithm as an optimization tool, the suggested technique chooses item sets to be sanitized (modified) from transactions that satisfy sensitive negative criteria with the goal of minimizing changes to the original database. Experiments with benchmark healthcare datasets show that the suggested privacy preserving data mining (PPDM) method outperforms existing algorithms in terms of Hiding Failure (HF), Artificial Rule Generation (AR), and Lost Rules (LR).","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3192447","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9832893","Privacy-preserving data mining;healthcare data;evolutionary computation;sanitization process","Medical services;Data privacy;Genetic algorithms;Databases;Optimization;Data integrity;Task analysis","data mining;data privacy;diseases;genetic algorithms;health care;medical information systems;search problems","privacy preserving data mining framework;negative association rules;healthcare informatics;healthcare information;data custodians;association rule mining;positive association rules;negative consequences;helpful information;sensitive information;healthcare data privacy protection;metaheuristic-based data sanitization;healthcare data mining;patient privacy;sensitive negative criteria;benchmark healthcare datasets;suggested privacy;Artificial Rule Generation;Lost Rules","","6","","64","CCBY","19 Jul 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, DL models are often strikingly vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Many researchers have aimed to develop adversarial attacks against DL models in realistic black-box settings (i.e., assuming no model knowledge is accessible to attackers). These attacks typically operate with a two-phase framework: (1) sensitivity estimation through gradient-based or deletion-based methods to evaluate the sensitivity of each token to the prediction of the target model, and (2) perturbation execution to craft adversarial examples based on the estimated token sensitivity. However, gradient-based and deletion-based methods used to estimate sensitivity often face issues of capturing token directionality and overlapping token sensitivities, respectively. In this study, we propose a novel eXplanation-based method for Adversarial Text Attacks (XATA) that leverages additive feature attribution explainable methods, namely LIME or SHAP, to measure the sensitivity of input tokens when crafting black-box adversarial attacks on DL models performing text classification or text regression. We evaluated XATA's attack performance on DL models executing text classification on the IMDB Movie Review, Yelp Reviews-Polarity, and Amazon Reviews-Polarity datasets and DL models conducting text regression on the My Personality, Drug Review, and CommonLit Readability datasets. The proposed XATA outperformed the existing gradient-based and deletion-based adversarial attack baselines in both tasks.

If features of the target are aggregated and classified simply, the discriminant features of the target will be ignored. This will affect the robustness of the trajectory generated by the model. Meanwhile, many popular models are keen to execute detection and feature extraction tasks in parallel. But these two tasks will conflict with each other when optimized respectively. Therefore, we propose our tracker MOTFR to solve the above problems. In this paper, we propose a Locally Shared Information Decoupling Module (LSIDM) to reduce task optimization conflicts while ensuring the necessary information sharing. Meanwhile, a feature recoding module for deep extraction of identity discriminative features is proposed, which is called the Feature Purification Module (FPM). By combining LSIDM and FPM modules, the model utilizes the discriminative appearance features to guide the optimization of detection and further improves the performance of our model. To solve the problem of targets disappearing due to various abnormal occlusion, a Short-term Trajectory Online Complement Strategy (STOCS) is proposed to realize the trajectories continuation of these targets in the tracking stage.

We propose a fine-grained application model for serverless applications, and use it to design a scheduler to improve application performance and efficiency. We model serverless applications as being composed of microtasks, each with its own unique resource requirements. Microtasks are easily identified via distinct application phases like initialize, read, and process. We provide evidence for the existence of microtasks by experimentally evaluating a serverless online game. We design a scheduler that separates microtasks with different CPU requirements into different queues so that the appropriate amount of CPU cores could be allocated to each queue based on the CPU requirements of the microtasks in that queue. We implement and evaluate the design in an application-level proofof-concept microtask-based scheduler and compare it to taskbased scheduling commonly used by serverless platforms. For a distributed sort application, the microtask-based scheduler decreases application makespan by 37% and the duration of I/O based application stages by 81%, compared to task-based scheduling. Our work suggests that there is potential in extracting and using microtask information from serverless applications.","","978-1-6654-6087-3","10.1109/UCC56403.2022.00066","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10061809","cloud;serverless;performance;scheduling;game","Processor scheduling;Computational modeling;Serverless computing;Games;Data mining;Task analysis","cloud computing;computer games;queueing theory;resource allocation;scheduling","application-level proof-of-concept microtask-based scheduler;cloud computing;CPU core allocation;CPU requirements;distinct application phases;distributed sort application;fine-grained application model;microtask information;microtask queueing;serverless applications;serverless computing;serverless online game","","","","23","IEEE","14 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, there are two main challenges in modeling multimodal sequences: 1) the different sampling rates from multimodal data make the cross-modal interactions very difficult; 2) how to efficiently fuse unimodal representations and effectively capture relationships among multimodal data. In this paper, we design the weighted cross-modal attention mechanism, which not only captures the temporal correlation information and the spatial dependence information of each modality, but also dynamically adjusts the weight of each modality across different time steps. And the unimodal subtasks are led for assisting the representation learning of specific modality to jointly train the multimodal tasks and unimodal subtasks to explore the complementary relationships of each modality. Our model gets a new state-of-the-art record on the CMU-MOSI dataset and brings noticeable performance improvements on all the metrics. For the CMU-MOSEI dataset, the F1 score of the binary classification, the 7-class task, and the regression task of our model are still the highest among all models and the proposed model is only lower than the multimodal split attention fusion (MSAF) model with aligned data on the accuracy of the binary classification, showing the great performance of the suggested method.","2329-9304","","10.1109/TASLP.2022.3192728","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62066009); Key Research and Development Project of Guilin(grant numbers:2020010308); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9834131","Cross-modal attention;joint optimization;multimodal sentiment analysis;multi-task learning;multimodal fusion","Task analysis;Data models;Acoustics;Logic gates;Visualization;Sentiment analysis;Representation learning","brain;data mining;emotion recognition;feature extraction;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;text analysis;video signal processing","multimodal data;cross-modal interactions;unimodal representations;weighted cross-modal attention mechanism;temporal correlation information;spatial dependence information;unimodal subtasks;specific modality;multimodal tasks;multimodal split attention fusion model;sentiment prediction auxiliary task;multimodal sentiment;spatial information;temporal semantic information;multimodalities;multimodal sequences","","2","","35","IEEE","20 Jul 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The blockchain mining process requires high computing power to solve a Proof-of-Work (PoW) puzzle, which is hard to implement on users’ mobile devices. So these miners may leverage the edge/cloud service providers (ESPs/CSP) to calculate the PoW puzzle. The existing edge-assisted blockchain networks assumed that all ESPs have a uniform propagation delay, which is unrealistic. In this article, we consider a more practical scene where ESPs locate in diverse positions of the blockchain network, which causes different propagation delays when supporting the computation of the PoW puzzle. Additionally, these ESPs connect to a remote CSP for resource scheduling when the computing tasks exceed their maximum capacity. The blockchain mining process generally involves complicated competition and games among CSP, ESPs, and miners. Each service provider focuses on how to determine his resource price so that he can maximize his utility. According to the set resource price, each miner concentrates on scheduling his resource requests for each ESP to maximize individual personal utility, which depends on ESPs’ resource price and propagation delays. We first model such a resource pricing and scheduling problem as a three-stage multi-leader multi-follower Stackelberg game and aim at finding the Stackelberg equilibrium. Then, we analyze the subgame optimization problem in each stage and propose an iterative algorithm based on backward induction to achieve the Nash equilibrium of the Stackelberg game.

Online workflow executes in a collaborative and distributed environment and is prone to fraud and information leakage. Workflow authorization models are implemented to ensure that tasks are performed by authorized subjects with compliance of security/privacy polices. However, existing workflow authorization models have some limitations. First, most of the existing research focuses on static workflows, where an order arriving at a workflow traverses tasks in a fixed sequence. In many real applications, however, task routing is not deterministic, having a probability distribution or pattern that may be estimated from historical data. Second, existing research ignores practical resource constraints, like user utilization, order waiting time, etc. To address the limitations, this article studies the workflow authorization model under the more realistic dynamic settings. We formulate a workflow as a queueing system, so business constraints can be analytically represented, under reasonable assumptions. We model the studied problems as pseudo-Boolean satisfiaiblity problems and investigate their theoretical properties. We also develop algorithms and carry out computational studies.

To cope with this challenge, with the assistance of mobile-edge computing (MEC), offloading complex tasks from MDs to edge cloud servers (CSs) or central CSs can reduce the computational burden of devices and improve the efficiency of task processing. However, it is difficult to obtain optimal offloading decisions by conventional heuristic optimization methods, because the decision-making problem is usually NP-hard. In addition, there are shortcomings in using intelligent decision-making methods, e.g., lack of training samples and poor ability of migration under different MEC environments. To this end, we propose a novel offloading algorithm named meta reinforcement-deep reinforcement learning-based offloading, consisting of a meta-reinforcement learning (meta-RL) model, which improves the migration ability of the whole model, and a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) model, which combines multiple parallel deep neural networks (DNNs) to learn from historical task offloading scenarios.

The worst-case completion time of a DAG must be bounded and schedulability analysis must be conducted during the design phase to estimate the required hardware resources. Typical examples include automotive systems and Ultra-Reliable Low Latency Communications (URLLC), which is the “to-business” protocol in 5G technologies, deployed in industrial automation for instance. To bound the execution time of multiple DAGs, there are two key factors to analyze: the intra-task interference for a single DAG and the inter-task interference between DAGs. While extensive efforts have been invested, the existing methods either still contain a large degree of pessimism or are even erroneous due to errors in the derived analysis. In this paper, we first provide an indepth analysis of the limitation and defects of the existing methods. Inspired by these observations, we construct novel response time analysis for multiple DAG tasks with arbitrary intra-task priority assignment. Our analysis precisely accounts for both the intra- and inter-task interference by fully exploring the node parallelism in each DAG as well as between DAGs. Extensive experimental results show that the proposed analysis obtains tighter bounds and improves the system scheduability by at least 300 % compared to state-of-the-art approaches. This improvement is even larger when the scheduling pressure is relatively high, up to 100 % versus 0 % in many cases. This work notably advances the use of response time analysis in industry. Practitioners have to resort to either potentially unsafe measurement results or significant resource over-provisioning when precise analysis is unavailable.","2642-7346","979-8-3503-2176-0","10.1109/RTAS58335.2023.00021","Innovate UK; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10155677","","Industries;Protocols;Job shop scheduling;Interference;Ultra reliable low latency communication;Parallel processing;Real-time systems","","","","","","22","IEEE","23 Jun 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The satellite images contain enormous data that can be used in various applications. The analysis of the data is a tedious task due to the amount of data and the heterogeneity of the data. Thus, in this paper, a Radial Basis Function Neural Network (RBFNN) trained using Manta Ray Foraging Optimization algorithm (MRFO) is proposed. RBFNN is a three-layer network comprising of input, output, and hidden layers that can process large amounts. The trained network can discover hidden data patterns in unseen data. The learning algorithm and seed selection play a vital role in the performance of the network. The seed selection is done using the spectral indices to further improve the performance of the network. The manta ray foraging optimization algorithm is inspired by the intelligent behaviour of manta rays. It emulates three unique foraging behaviours namelys chain, cyclone, and somersault foraging. The satellite images contain enormous amount of data and thus require exploration in large search space. The spiral movement of the MRFO algorithm enables it to explore large search spaces effectively. The proposed method is applied on pre and post flooding Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) images of New Brunswick area. The method was applied to identify and classify the land cover changes in the area induced by flooding. The images are classified using the proposed method and a change map is developed using post classification comparison. The change map shows that a large amount of agricultural area was washed away due to flooding. The measurement of the affected area in square kilometres is also performed for mitigation activities. The results show that post flooding the area covered by water is increased whereas the vegetated area is decreased. The performance of the proposed method is done with existing state-of-the-art methods.","2096-0654","","10.26599/BDMA.2022.9020027","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9962957","Radial Basis Function Neural Network (RBFNN);Manta Ray Foraging Optimization algorithm (MRFO);Landsat 8;classification;change detection;disaster mitigation;planning","Training;Satellites;Spirals;Radial basis function networks;Agriculture;Classification algorithms;Floods;Task analysis;Optimization;Image classification","agriculture;geophysical image processing;image classification;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;radial basis function networks;remote sensing","data patterns;enormous data;hidden layers;hybrid Manta Ray Foraging Optimization Neural Network;image classification method;learning algorithm;Manta Ray Foraging Optimization algorithm;MRFO algorithm;post classification comparison;Radial Basis Function Neural Network;RBFNN;satellite image classification;satellite images;search space;seed selection;somersault foraging;trained network","","","","22","","24 Nov 2022","","","TUP","TUP Journals"

However, in real-world environments, a human usually only has a general goal (e.g., general direction or area in motion planning) at the beginning of the cooperation, which needs to be clarified to a specific goal (i.e., an exact position) during cooperation. The specification process is interactive and dynamic, which depends on the environment and the partner’s behavior. The robot that does not consider the goal specification process may cause frustration to the human partner, elongate the time to come to an agreement, and compromise team performance. This work presents the Evolutionary Value Learning approach to model the dynamics of the goal specification process with State-based Multivariate Bayesian Inference and goal specificity-related features.

For large publishers, simultaneously selling impressions through both guaranteed contracts and in-house RTB has become a popular choice. Generally speaking, a publisher needs to derive an impression allocation strategy between guaranteed contracts and RTB to maximize its overall outcome (e.g., revenue and/or impression quality). However, deriving the optimal strategy is not a trivial task, e.g., the strategy should encourage incentive compatibility in RTB and tackle common challenges in real-world applications such as unstable traffic patterns (e.g., impression volume and bid landscape changing). In this paper, we formulate impression allocation as an auction problem where each guaranteed contract submits virtual bids for individual impressions. With this formulation, we derive the optimal bidding functions for the guaranteed contracts, which result in the optimal impression allocation. In order to address the unstable traffic pattern challenge and achieve the optimal overall outcome, we propose a multi-agent reinforcement learning method to adjust the bids from each guaranteed contract, which is simple, converging efficiently and scalable. The experiments conducted on real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.","2374-8486","978-1-6654-2398-4","10.1109/ICDM51629.2021.00086","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9679079","impression allocation;reinforcement learning;display advertising","Conferences;Reinforcement learning;Traffic control;Real-time systems;Resource management;Data mining;Advertising","advertising data processing;contracts;learning (artificial intelligence);multi-agent systems;optimisation","impression allocation strategy;optimal strategy;impression volume;guaranteed contract;individual impressions;optimal bidding functions;optimal impression allocation;online display advertising;publisher;in-house RTB;virtual bids","","","","29","IEEE","24 Jan 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Cloud computing provides services through Cloud Service Providers (CSPs). Cloud computing is mainly used for delivering solutions to a large number of business and scientific applications. Large-scale scientific applications are evaluated through cloud computing in the form of scientific workflows. Scientific workflows are data-intensive applications, and a single scientific workflow may be comprised of thousands of tasks. Deadline constraints, task failures, budget constraints, improper organization and management of tasks can cause inconvenience in executing scientific workflows. Therefore, we proposed a fault-tolerant and data-oriented scientific workflow management and scheduling system (FD-SWMS) in cloud computing. The proposed strategy applies a multi-criteria-based approach to schedule and manage the tasks of scientific workflows. The proposed strategy considers the special characteristics of tasks in scientific workflows, i.e., the scientific workflow tasks are executed simultaneously in parallel, in pipelined, aggregated to form a single task, and distributed to create multiple tasks. The proposed strategy schedules the tasks based on the data-intensiveness, provides a fault tolerant technique through a cluster-based approach, and makes it energy efficient through a load sharing mechanism. In order to find the effectiveness of the proposed strategy, the simulations are carried out on WorkflowSim for Montage and CyberShake workflows. The proposed FD-SWMS strategy performs better as compared with the existing state-of-the-art strategies. The proposed strategy on average reduced execution time by 25%, 17%, 22%, and 16%, minimized the execution cost by 24%, 17%, 21%, and 16%, and decreased the energy consumption by 21%, 17%, 20%, and 16%, as compared with existing QFWMS, EDS-DC, CFD, and BDCWS strategies, respectively for Montage scientific workflow.

The crowdsourcing platform provides an effective tool to leverage opinions from the Internet crowd. In this paper, we propose incorporating varied task importance, called Return of Interest (RoI), into resource allocation in crowdsourcing. The awareness of RoI is important in the business sense, but it introduces new challenges. In this paper, we propose a two-phase framework, called Macro-Assignment and Micro-Optimization (MAMO), to simultaneously consider the issue of budget allocation and the chance of iteratively obtaining RoI. With the fixed budget, we prove that worker allocation to diverse pools for the best expectation of RoI in return is a NPhard challenge. We propose a Dynamic-Programming strategy to resolve the issue effectively.

However, it is a challenging issue about how to make proper task offloading decisions among multiple connected BSs while satisfying delay requirements of multiple devices. To address this challenge, this article presents an efficient multidevice and multi-BSs task offloading scheme with the goal of minimizing the delay for completing the tasks of the devices. By conducting quantitative analysis of local delay and offloading delay, a nonlinear and nonconvex delay optimization offloading problem, which is based on the theory of noncooperative game, is formulated. We prove the existence of Nash equilibrium by analyzing the feature of the proposed offloading problem and further propose a distributed task offloading algorithm called DOLA.

A novel mobile blockchain network with the help of a mobile edge computing (MEC) server is presented, where all mobile users participate in the PoW mining process. The traditional Bitcoin network adjusts the target difficulty value to ensure a stable block time. However, for MEC-assisted mobile blockchain networks, the adjusted difficulty value needs to be broadcast to all mobile users, which results in expensive communication costs. To maintain a stable block time of mobile blockchain networks, we formulate the delay-limited computation offloading strategy of the PoW-based mining task as a non-cooperative game that maximizes an individual revenue in the MEC-assisted mobile blockchain network. Specifically, the non-cooperative game problem can be divided into multiple sub-game optimization problems to obtain final solutions for all users. We analyze the sub-game optimization problem and prove the existence of Nash equilibrium (NE) of the non-cooperative game. Moreover, we design an alternating iterative algorithm based on the continuous relaxation and greedy rounding (CRGR) to achieve the NE of this game. Given the sub-optimal delay-limited computation offloading results, we also derive the optimal transmit power for an individual user within the maximum mining delay range. From the analytical results, we can see that the proposed CRGR-based alternating iterative algorithm can efficiently attain the sub-optimal delay-limited computation offloading strategies of all mobile users in the polynomial time. The individual transmit power increases accordingly with the delay-limited computation offloading strategies of all users.

For this issue, this article proposes an adaptive reference vector reinforcement learning (RVRL) approach to decomposition-based algorithms for industrial copper burdening optimization. The proposed approach involves two main operations, that is: 1) a reinforcement learning (RL) operation and 2) a reference point sampling operation. Given the fact that the states of reference vectors interact with the landscape environment (quite often), the RL operation treats the reference vector adaption process as an RL task, where each reference vector learns from the environmental feedback and selects optimal actions for gradually fitting the problem characteristics. Accordingly, the reference point sampling operation uses estimation-of-distribution learning models to sample new reference points. Finally, the resultant algorithm is applied to handle the proposed industrial copper burdening problem. For this problem, an adaptive penalty function and a soft constraint-based relaxing approach are used to handle complex constraints. Experimental results on both benchmark problems and real-world instances verify the competitiveness and effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.","2168-2275","","10.1109/TCYB.2021.3086501","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61773103,61973305,61872073,71620107003,61673331,62032013); Liaoning Revitalization Talents Program(grant numbers:XLYC1902010,XLYC1802115); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9484680","Copper burdening optimization;many-objective optimization;reference vector reinforcement learning (RVRL)","Optimization;Adaptation models;Copper;Reinforcement learning","copper;evolutionary computation;learning (artificial intelligence);metallurgical industries;optimisation;production engineering computing;surface treatment;vectors","adaptive penalty function;adaptive reference vector reinforcement learning approach;decomposition-based algorithms;estimation-of-distribution learning models;industrial copper burdening optimization;industrial copper burdening problem;industrial copper burdening system;main operations;many-objective optimization;Pareto front shapes;problem characteristics;reference point sampling operation;reference points;reference vector adaption process;reference vector reinforcement learning adaption;reference vectors preset;reinforcement learning operation;resultant algorithm;RL operation;selects optimal actions;soft constraint-based relaxing approach","","52","","54","IEEE","14 Jul 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Since there is usually no solution that optimizes all objectives simultaneously, the aim is to identify a solution with acceptable trade-offs. Interactive multiobjective optimization methods are iterative processes in which a human decision maker repeatedly provides one’s preferences to request computing new solutions and compares them. With these methods, the decision maker can learn about the problem and its limitations. However, advanced optimization software usually offer simple visualization tools that can be significantly improved. On the other hand, current approaches for multiobjective optimization from the visualization community provide superior visualization tools but lack advanced optimization. In this paper, we introduce a new term, interactivize, for integrating interactive multiobjective optimization and interactive visualization and present an interactivized approach supporting decision makers in visually steering interactive multiobjective optimization methods. We integrate state-of-the-art interactive visualization with the process of interactive multiobjective optimization in a visual analytics solution that significantly improves the analysis workflow of decision makers, like comparing selected solutions and specifying new preferences during the iterative solution process. To realize the new interactivized approach, we combine a coordinated multiple views system with DESDEO, an open-source software framework for interactive multiobjective optimization.

In the classic AC architecture, the Critic (value) network is used to estimate the value function while the Actor (policy) network optimizes the policy according to the estimated value function. The efficiency of the classic AC architecture is limited due that the policy does not directly participate in the value function update. The classic AC architecture will make the value function estimation inaccurate, which will affect the performance of the PPO algorithm. For improvement, we designed a novel AC architecture with policy feedback (AC-PF) by introducing the policy into the update process of the value function and further proposed the PPO with policy feedback (PPO-PF). For the AC-PF architecture, the policy-based expected (PBE) value function and discount reward formulas are designed by drawing inspiration from expected Sarsa. In order to enhance the sensitivity of the value function to the change of policy and to improve the accuracy of PBE value estimation at the early learning stage, we proposed a policy update method based on the clipped discount factor. Moreover, we specifically defined the loss functions of the policy network and value network to ensure that the policy update of PPO-PF satisfies the unbiased estimation of the trust region. Experiments on Atari games and control tasks show that compared to PPO, PPO-PF has faster convergence speed, higher reward, and smaller variance of reward.","2168-2232","","10.1109/TSMC.2021.3098451","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61976215,61772532,U1813203); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9501950","Actor–critic (AC);clipped discount factor;policy feedback;proximal policy optimization (PPO);value function","Optimization;Estimation;Training;Task analysis;Trajectory;Space exploration;Games","convergence;deep learning (artificial intelligence);estimation theory;feedback;optimisation;reinforcement learning","AC-PF architecture;actor network;actor-critic architecture;Atari games;clipped discount factor;convergence speed;critic network;deep reinforcement learning algorithm;discount reward formula;loss function;PBE value estimation;PBE value function;policy feedback;policy network;policy update method;policy-based expected value function;PPO algorithm;PPO-PF;proximal policy optimization;value function estimation;value function update;value network","","2","","45","IEEE","29 Jul 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To tackle this problem, in this paper, we propose a novel approach called BuyerNorm which can identify different expression forms for a given buyer name. The proposed model takes pairs of variable length buyer names as input and combines Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) and Bi-directional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) to obtain string representations and calculate the similarity between the two names, which indicates whether they represent the same buyer.

Most attention architectures cannot explore the discriminative person representations for VTReID, especially in the thermal modality. In addition, the fine-grained middle-level semantic information has received much less attention in the part-based approaches for the cross-modality pedestrian retrieval task, resulting in limited generalization capability and poor representation robustness. This paper proposes a simple yet powerful discriminative local representation learning (DLRL) model to capture the robust local fine-grained feature representations and explore the rich semantic relationship between the learned part features. Specifically, an efficient contextual attention aggregation module (CAAM) is designed to strengthen the discriminative capability of the feature representations and explore the contextual cues for visible and thermal modalities. Then, an integrated middle-high feature learning (IMHF) method is introduced to capture the part-level salient representations, which handles the ambiguous modality discrepancy in both discriminative middle-level and robust high-level information. Moreover, a part-guided graph convolution module (PGCM) is constructed to mine the structural relationship among the part representations within each modality.

Delays and bad recovery strategies after disasters or failures can lead to impairing impacts in terms of injury to people, environmental pollution and loss of time, money and resources. In such a context, the adoption of a spatial Decision Support System (DSS) might play a crucial role in order to help operators to adopt the best recovery strategy in the shortest possible time frame. Current approaches do not consider the problem of assigning an intervention location to a maintenance crew and do not account for the effective time needed for emergency intervention. In this paper we develop a novel spatial multi-criteria DSS methodology for prioritizing repair interventions on power networks. The multi criteria strategy is solved by the adoption of Incomplete Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) which computes holistic assignment costs as the result of the combination of multiple and possibly conflicting metrics of cost. Then, we use the holistic costs as the basis for a task assignment phase that is based on the Hungarian algorithm. The proposed strategy has been implemented as a module in the Decision Support System, namely Critical Infrastructure Protection Risk Analysis and Forecast (CIPCast), whose outputs are represented on a web-based Geographic Information System (GIS) platform. The effectiveness of the proposed multi-criteria strategy has been validated via a real case study on the Rome City electrical distribution network.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3264686","Italian Ministry for Ecologic Transition in the Framework of the Triennial Plan 2019–2021 of the National Research on the Electrical System (Piano Triennale 2019–2021 Della Ricerca di Sistema Elettrico Nazionale); Italian Ministry of Education, University and Research through the Project RoMA (Resilience Enhancement of Metropolitan Areas)(grant numbers:SCN_00064); Italian Ministry of Education, University and Research through the Project RAFAEL (System for Risk Analysis and Forecast for Critical Infrastructures in the AppenninEs dorsaL Regions)(grant numbers:ARS01_00305); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10092755","Decision support;multi-criteria decision aiding;power networks;repair prioritization;incomplete analytic hierarchy process;assignment problem;Hungarian algorithm;CIPCast","Decision support systems;Costs;Maintenance engineering;Urban areas;Critical infrastructure;Analytic hierarchy process","analytic hierarchy process;business continuity;critical infrastructures;decision making;decision support systems;disasters;distribution networks;geographic information systems;maintenance engineering;risk analysis","bad recovery strategies;Critical Infrastructure Protection Risk Analysis;Critical Infrastructures;disasters;effective time;emergency intervention;holistic assignment costs;holistic costs;impairing impacts;intervention location;multicriteria strategy;novel spatial multicriteria DSS methodology;power networks;prioritizing repair interventions;public;recovery strategy;shortest possible time frame;spatial Decision Support System;task assignment phase;web-based Geographic Information System platform","","","","44","CCBYNCND","5 Apr 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, for hyperspectral images (HSIs) obtained by the same sensor, the spectral information has a similar physical meaning (radiance or reflectivity). Collaborative analysis technology can analyze multiple hyperspectral datasets to explore the inherent spectral features shared among them. In this letter, a multiple datasets collaborative analysis framework for hyperspectral band selection is proposed to realize spectral information communication, thereby guiding and promoting the band selection of each dataset. Different band selection tasks are established pertinently, and then, the evolutionary multitasking band selection method is designed to facilitate the knowledge sharing of different band selection tasks. More importantly, the interaction mechanism among different datasets is adjusted dynamically, thereby improving the cooperation ability of the collaborative analysis framework. Besides, a predominant gene reservation crossover and a deduplication mutation are designed for retaining the promising bands and avoiding the selection of repeat bands.

However, in practical applications, due to the strong fitting ability of the feature extractor in the deep learning model, the use efficiency of the CRF layer is relatively low; at the same time, the calculation cost of the CRF layer is relatively large. This paper proposes a performance optimization algorithm for the CRF layer in the sequence annotation task based on the deep learning model. The algorithm introduces five rules. First of all, the tag result of the feature extractor is checked by the five rules, if the adjacent tag is found to be logically incorrect, then use the CRF layer for logic correction.

In this study, we develop a combined deep learning method named PhenoBERT for this purpose. PhenoBERT uses BERT, currently the state-of-the-art NLP model, as its core model for evaluating whether a clinically relevant text segment (CTS) could be represented by an HPO term. However, to avoid unnecessary comparison of a CTS with each of ∼14,000 HPO terms using BERT, we introduce a two-levels CNN module consisting of a series of CNN models organized at two levels in PhenoBERT. For a given CTS, the CNN module produces only a short list of candidate HPO terms for BERT to evaluate, significantly improving the computational efficiency. In addition, BERT is able to assign an ancestor HPO term to a CTS when recognition of the direct HPO term is not successful, mimicking the process of HPO term assignment by human. In two benchmarks, PhenoBERT outperforms four traditional dictionary-based methods and two recently developed deep learning-based methods in two benchmark tests, and its advantage is more obvious when the recognition task is more challenging. As such, PhenoBERT is of great use for assisting in the mining of clinical text data.","1557-9964","","10.1109/TCBB.2022.3170301","National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2021YFC2301500); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:32170667,31871325); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9763337","BERT;biomedical ontologies;concept recognition;deep learning;human phenotype ontology;medical text mining","Bit error rate;Ontologies;Text recognition;Deep learning;Benchmark testing;Task analysis;Genetics","convolutional neural nets;data mining;deep learning (artificial intelligence);feature extraction;learning (artificial intelligence);natural language processing;ontologies (artificial intelligence);text analysis","automated recognition;BERT;clinical data mining;clinical text data;clinical texts;clinically relevant text segment;CNN models;combined deep learning method;core model;direct HPO term;given CTS;HPO term assignment;Human Phenotype Ontology terms;PhenoBERT;recently developed deep learning-based methods;recognition task;state-of-the-art NLP model;traditional dictionary-based methods;two-levels CNN module","Humans;Deep Learning;Benchmarking;Data Mining;Family;Phenotype","","","29","IEEE","26 Apr 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Essentially, the method generates an Assembly Task Sequence Graph (ATSG) by recognizing a graphical instruction manual. An ATSG is a graph describing the assembly task procedure by detecting types of parts included in the instruction images, completing the missing information automatically, and correcting the detection errors automatically. To build an ATSG, the proposed method first extracts the information of the parts contained in each image of the graphical instruction manual. Then, by using the extracted part information, it estimates the proper work motions and tools for the assembly task. After that, the method builds an ATSG by considering the relationship between the previous and following images, which makes it possible to estimate the undetected parts caused by occlusion using the information of the entire image series. Finally, by collating the total number of each part with the generated ATSG, the excess or deficiency of parts are investigated, and task procedures are removed or added according to those parts. In the experiment section, we build an ATSG using the proposed method to a graphical instruction manual for a chair and demonstrate the action sequences found in the ATSG can be performed by a dual-arm robot execution.

The annual throughput of Huanghua port keeps around 200 million tonnes for the last three years, which accounts for 7% of the overall coal consumption in China. As a leading coal terminal in automation, Huanghua port implemented an inbound-to-outbound unmanned operation system in 2020. Intelligent logistics management is the next target to achieve a system-wide operation efficiency. This could be a challenging task due to several safety issues. Firstly, two stockpiles sometimes must be reclaimed simultaneously to accomplish a blending process when loading onto vessels. This may increase their collision risk if the two reclaimers are on the same track. Secondly, operations on one stockpile consist of stacking operations while coals are dumped onto the stockpile, and reclaiming operations while coals are reclaimed from the stockpile. Therefore scheduling of these operations must be aligned such that coals on stockpiles do not exceeds their safety inventories. Moreover, ship loading operations are delicate due to the stability and strength requirements of vessels. In this case, reclaiming and ship loading of the cargos of one vessel must follow a pre-defined sequence. These issues make the operation planning and scheduling of the port logistics system very complicated, and most of these tasks are stilled handled by humans. However, even the most experienced planners can make only short-term local decisions. Once the problem sizes are getting larger, operation conflicts may occur which leads to a system interruption. In this study, the scheduling problem is modeled and solved with constraint programming, a fundamental technique in artificial intelligence [1]. Specifically, the afore mentioned safety issues are captured and addressed with some global constraints provided by IBM ILOG CP solver [2]. Based on a comprehensive experimental analysis, parameters of solving engines are tuned for a better solution. Computational results verified the correctness and effectiveness of this approach. Real world data shows that the presented method is able to effectively improve the operation efficiency and service level of the coal port.","","978-1-6654-3885-8","10.1109/ICUS52573.2021.9641241","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:71501152); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9641241","unmanned coal port operation;scheduling;constraint programming","Constraint handling;Target tracking;Loading;Coal;Seaports;Throughput;Safety","artificial intelligence;blending;coal;constraint handling;decision making;freight handling;logistics;mechanical stability;mechanical strength;mining industry;safety;scheduling;sea ports;ships","Huanghua port;coal consumption;intelligent logistics management;stacking operations;ship loading operations;operation planning;port logistics system;constraint programming;safety issues;outbound operation scheduling problem;unmanned coal port system;inbound operation scheduling problem;China;stockpiles;blending process;vessels loading;collision risk;stability requirements;strength requirements;cargos;artificial intelligence;IBM ILOG CP solver;experimental analysis;mass 200.0 tonne","","","","11","IEEE","22 Dec 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, the underlying challenge of video captioning, i.e., sequence to sequence mapping across the different domains, is still not well handled. To address these problems, we introduce the polishing mechanism in an attempt to mimic human polishing process and propose a generate-and-polish framework for video captioning. In this paper, we propose a two-step transformer based polishing network (TSTPN) consisting of two sub-modules: the generation-module is to generate the caption candidate and the polishing-module is to gradually refine the generated candidate. Specifically, the candidate provides a global information of the visual contents in a semantically-meaningful order, where it is firstly considered as a semantic intersnubber to bridge the semantic gap between the text and video, with the cross-modal attention mechanism for better cross-modal modeling; and it secondly provides a global planning ability to maintain the semantic consistency and fluency of the whole sentence for better sequence mapping. In experiments, we present adequate evaluations to show that the proposed TSTPN achieves the comparable and even better performance than the state-of-the-art methods on the benchmark datasets.","1558-2205","","10.1109/TCSVT.2022.3165934","Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(grant numbers:2021RC216); NSFC(grant numbers:62006015,61672089,61971446,61572064,61906013); CEFLA Audio-Video Restoration and Evaluation Key Laboratory of Ministry of Culture and Tourism; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9751606","Video captioning;transformer;polishing mechanism;cross-modal modeling","Semantics;Visualization;Decoding;Transformers;Task analysis;Planning;Training","computer vision;feature extraction;learning (artificial intelligence);natural language processing;natural languages;path planning;polishing;text analysis;video signal processing","bridging video;two-step polishing transformer;video captioning;natural language processing;video content;natural language sentences;captions;sequence mapping;polishing mechanism;human polishing process;generate- polish framework;-polish framework;two-step transformer based polishing network;caption candidate;polishing-module","","","","58","IEEE","8 Apr 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Therefore, the processing speed of big data systems is more important than ever. On the other hand, protecting a big data system is not easy, as various types of nodes and clusters are supported by various wired and wireless networks. Commonly security procedures slow down the response time of big data networks, and therefore, enhanced security and performance speed techniques need to be co-designed into the system. In this paper, a trusted streaming adaptive failure-compensation (TSAF) scheme is proposed that uses a trust management scheme to identify malicious nodes in Spark big data systems, exclude them from job/task processing, and calculate the number of nodes that can satisfy the process’s object completion time. The TSAF scheme shows an improved processing performance when there are attacks on the big data system compared to other existing real-time big data processing schemes. For the case of no security attack, the results show that the processing time of TSAF is faster by about 1 ~ 2% compared to the existing big data processing schemes when the process completion object time is set to 0.5 s. Even when the ratio of malicious nodes performing security attacks on worker nodes reaches 0.5, the results show that TSAF can satisfy over 75% of the tasks within the object time, which is significantly higher compared to the existing big data processing schemes.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3129885","Ministry of Science and ICT (MSIT), South Korea, under the Information Technology Research Center (ITRC) support Program through the Institute for Information and Communications Technology Planning and Evaluation (IITP)(grant numbers:IITP-2021-2018-0-01799); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9623558","Trust management;big data;time bound optimization;real-time processing;security","Big Data;Trust management;Security;Computational complexity;Real-time systems;Databases;Data processing","Big Data;security of data;trusted computing","smart systems;response time;big data networks;performance speed techniques;malicious nodes;security attack;process completion object time;adaptive trust management;data process time optimization;real-time Spark big data systems;trust management;adaptive failure-compensation;trusted streaming adaptive failure-compensation;TSAF","","","","15","CCBY","22 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

It has excellent capabilities in specific practice. However, the decision tree model used in the classification process for random forest traverses all attribute values to find the split points, which leads to over-fitting and reduction of algorithm efficiency. In addition, the meta-base models of random forests vote with the same weight, which may result in decreasing algorithm accuracy. In this paper we accomplish the following two optimization tasks. Firstly, the continuous attributes are discretized based on the boundary theorem of Fayyad and Irani. Secondly, Gaussian mixture model is used to adjust the weight of the meta-base models in optimized random forest according to the similarity between the subsets and the training sets. Finally, the optimized algorithm is applied to the student information data set and the terrain types data set. The experiment results show that the optimized algorithm can effectively improve the classification efficiency and prediction accuracy.","","978-1-6654-4149-0","10.1109/CCIS53392.2021.9754599","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9754599","Random forest;Decision tree;Data mining;Gaussian mixture model;Boundary theorem","Training;Learning systems;Machine learning algorithms;Optimization methods;Prediction algorithms;Classification algorithms;Task analysis","data mining;decision trees;Gaussian processes;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification","random forest traverses all attribute values;algorithm efficiency;meta-base models;random forests vote;algorithm accuracy;optimization tasks;continuous attributes;Gaussian mixture model;optimized random forest;optimized algorithm;student information data;terrain types data;classification efficiency;prediction accuracy;efficient learning method;machine learning;artificial intelligence;excellent capabilities;specific practice;decision tree model;classification process","","","","23","IEEE","14 Apr 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Self-supervised learning does not rely on a large amount of labeled data and reduces the loss of human labeled information. Compared with natural images, remote sensing images require rich samples and human annotation by experts. Moreover, many algorithms have poor interpretability and unconvincing results. Therefore, this article proposes a self-supervised method based on prototype assignment by designing a pretext task so that the network maps features to prototypes in the process of learning, swaps the code corresponding to the obtained features, combines them with another data-enhancing feature, and then optimizes the network. The prototype is introduced to explain the clustering idea embodied in the whole process. Considering the existence of the scene information-rich characteristic of remote sensing images, we introduce multiple views with different resolutions to capture more detailed information on the images. Finally, if the data enhancement method is not powerful enough, the network can easily fall into an overfitting state, which prevents the network from learning subtle differences and detailed information. To address this shortcoming, we propose a fusion strategy to flatten the decision boundary of the framework so that the model can also learn the soft similarity between sample pairs. We name the whole framework multiview fusion feature sample mining based on prototype clustering (MFPC). In extensive experiments conducted on three common remote sensing image datasets (i.e., UCMerced, AID, and NWPU45), MFPC achieves a maximum improvement of 4.3% over some existing self-supervised algorithms, indicating that it can achieve good results.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2022.3216831","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62171347,61877066,61771379,62001355,62101405); Foundation for Innovative Research Groups of the National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61621005); Key Research and Development Program in Shaanxi Province of China(grant numbers:2019ZDLGY03-05,2021ZDLGY02-08); Science and Technology Program, Xi’an, China(grant numbers:XA2020-RGZNTJ-0021); Higher Education Discipline Innovation Project; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9933708","Clustering idea;fusion strategy;interpretability;multiple views;prototype assignment;self-supervised learning","Remote sensing;Task analysis;Self-supervised learning;Prototypes;Training;Codes;Predictive models","data mining;geophysical image processing;image classification;image fusion;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;pattern clustering;remote sensing;unsupervised learning","common remote sensing image datasets;data enhancement method;data-enhancing feature;existing self-supervised algorithms;fusion feature sample mining;fusion strategy;human annotation;human labeled information;natural images;network maps features;poor interpretability;prototype assignment;prototype clustering;prototypes;remote sensing image scene classification;remote sensing images;rich samples;scene information-rich characteristic;self-supervised learning;self-supervised method;self-supervised visual representation learning;unconvincing results","","4","","47","IEEE","31 Oct 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this context, employee attrition presents a critical problem and a big risk for organizations as it affects not only their productivity but also their planning continuity. In this context, the salient contributions of this research are as follows. Firstly, we propose a people analytics approach to predict employee attrition that shifts from a big data to a deep data context by focusing on data quality instead of its quantity. In fact, this deep data-driven approach is based on a mixed method to construct a relevant employee attrition model in order to identify key employee features influencing his/her attrition. In this method, we started thinking `big' by collecting most of the common features from the literature (an exploratory research) then we tried thinking `deep' by filtering and selecting the most important features using survey and feature selection algorithms (a quantitative method). Secondly, this attrition prediction approach is based on machine, deep and ensemble learning models and is experimented on a large-sized and a medium-sized simulated human resources datasets and then a real small-sized dataset from a total of 450 responses. Our approach achieves higher accuracy (0.96, 0.98 and 0.99 respectively) for the three datasets when compared previous solutions. Finally, while rewards and payments are generally considered as the most important keys to retention, our findings indicate that `business travel', which is less common in the literature, is the leading motivator for employees and must be considered within HR policies to retention.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3074559","ERASMUS + KA2 Projects “Information Technology Governance for Tunisian Universities”(grant numbers:561614-EPP-1-2015-1-ES-EPPKA2-CBHE-JP); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9409047","Deep people analytics;employee attrition;retention;prediction;interpretation;policies recommendation","Big Data;Organizations;Radio frequency;Predictive models;Support vector machines;Data models;Analytical models","Big Data;data analysis;data mining;human factors;human resource management;learning (artificial intelligence);organisational aspects;personnel;statistical analysis","deep data context;data quality;deep data-driven approach;relevant employee attrition model;key employee features;feature selection algorithms;attrition prediction approach;ensemble learning models;medium-sized simulated human resources datasets;employees;employee attrition prediction;data science;big data analytics;organizations;human resources managers;attracting retaining talent;big risk;people analytics approach","","15","","40","CCBY","20 Apr 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, the short-term methodology has one critical limitation, which conflicts with the real mechanism of our visual system — a typical long-term methodology. As a result, failure cases keep showing up in the results of the current SOTA models, and the short-term methodology becomes the major technical bottleneck. To solve this problem, this paper proposes a novel VSOD approach, which performs VSOD in a complete long-term way. Our approach converts the sequential VSOD, a sequential task, to a data mining problem, i.e., decomposing the input video sequence to object proposals in advance and then mining salient object proposals as much as possible in an easy-to-hard way.

In addition, we devised an online updating scheme that can grasp the most representative and trustworthy pattern profile of the salient objects, outputting framewise saliency maps with rich details and smoothing both spatially and temporally.

Despite that, most of the existing EA-based EE algorithms mainly take advantage of the global search capability of evolutionary computation. A few of them focus on the hyperspectral EE task itself, which is a sparse large-scale problem with constraint. To fill the gap, in this article, a global-to-local EA (GL-EA) is proposed, where the global and local search is performed sequentially to extract the endmembers effectively. Specifically, in the first global search stage, two complementary solution generation strategies, including asymmetric flip-based solution generation and spectral angle distance (SAD)-based solution repair, are designed, with which the sparse large-scale search space of hyperspectral EE is fully explored and the endmembers that satisfy the constraint could be achieved. Then, in the second stage, a perturbation-based local search is suggested, which further enhances the quality of the obtained endmembers. In addition, an endmember repetition-based solution selection strategy is also developed for both global and local search stages, by using which good solutions can be selected effectively during the evolution. Experimental results on different hyperspectral datasets demonstrate that when compared with the state-of-the-art EE algorithms, the proposed GL-EA could extract the endmembers with higher quality.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2023.3242364","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62076001,62106002,61976001,61874156); Natural Science Foundation of Anhui Province(grant numbers:2008085QF309,1908085MF218,2108085MF193); Key Program of Natural Science Project of Educational Commission of Anhui Province(grant numbers:KJ2021A0048,2022AH050088); University Synergy Innovation Program of Anhui Province(grant numbers:GXXT-2020-050,GXXT-2022-034); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10036465","Endmember extraction (EE);evolutionary algorithm (EA);global-to-local search;hyperspectral image (HSI);multiobjective optimization","Optimization;Hyperspectral imaging;Search problems;Task analysis;Sparse matrices;Indexes;Data mining","evolutionary computation;feature extraction;geophysical image processing;hyperspectral imaging;search problems","endmember repetition-based solution selection strategy;evolutionary algorithms;GL-EA;hyperspectral EE task;hyperspectral endmember extraction task;large-scale search space;local evolutionary algorithm;perturbation-based local search;SAD;sparse large-scale problem;spectral angle distance-based solution repair","","","","61","IEEE","3 Feb 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The aerial images may get captured with Modern means like satellites or drones. Additionally, the remote sensing technique gathers crucial data that may be applied to various planning tasks, including urban planning, conservation, forestry, land use, and many more. Urban regions may extract valuable information about land use and land cover from Very High Resolution (VHR) satellite pictures. Before practical usage is feasible, further research needs to be done on the many approaches that are now accessible. A machine learning technique called the ensemble technique combines many base models to create a single, ideal prediction model. In this paper, firstly, the extraction of features using TSBTC and then triangle thresholding is applied to the land usage dataset. After extracting features, a different ML algorithm is applied to compare the accuracy.Further, the triangle thresholding-based local features are ensembled with TSBTC II-ary global feature extraction technique to enhance performance. Additionally, in addition to the nine distinct ML algorithms, the recommended land use detection method uses three different ensembles of ML algorithms to evaluate performance. Results from the examination of this ensemble approach are based on the Land Use Dataset provided by UC Merced to demonstrate the benefit of using this ensemble method for classifying land use and significantly enhancing stand-alone methods.","","979-8-3503-2092-3","10.1109/INOCON57975.2023.10101262","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10101262","Feature Extraction;Image processing;TSBTC;Triangle thresholding","Technological innovation;Satellites;Machine learning algorithms;Urban planning;Predictive models;Feature extraction;Classification algorithms","data mining;feature extraction;forestry;geophysical image processing;image classification;land cover;land use;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;remote sensing;town and country planning","aerial imagery;aerial images;base models;different ML algorithm;drones;ensemble approach;ensemble technique;fundamental resource;High Resolution satellite pictures;ideal prediction model;land cover;land usage dataset;Land Usage Mining;Land Use Dataset;Land Use identification;landform mapping;machine learning technique;planning tasks;proper usage;recommended land use detection method;remote sensing technique gathers crucial data;satellites;sensing techniques;significant resource;single prediction model;thepade SBTC;triangle thresholding-based local features;TSBTC II-ary global feature extraction technique;urban planning;urban regions","","","","26","IEEE","19 Apr 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Separability-based NMF is mainly handled by two types of approaches, namely, greedy pursuit and convex programming. A notable convex NMF formulation is the so-called self-dictionary multiple measurement vectors (SD-MMV), which can work without knowing the matrix rank a priori, and is arguably more resilient to error propagation relative to greedy pursuit. However, convex SD-MMV renders a large memory cost that scales quadratically with the problem size. This memory challenge has been around for a decade, and a major obstacle for applying convex SD-MMV to big data analytics. This work proposes a memory-efficient algorithm for convex SD-MMV. Our algorithm capitalizes on the special update rules of a classic algorithm from the 1950s, namely, the Frank-Wolfe (FW) algorithm. It is shown that, under reasonable conditions, the FW algorithm solves the noisy SD-MMV problem with a memory cost that grows linearly with the amount of data. To handle noisier scenarios, a smoothed group sparsity regularizer is proposed to improve robustness while maintaining the low memory footprint with guarantees. The proposed approach presents the first linear memory complexity algorithmic framework for convex SD-MMV based NMF. The method is tested over a couple of unsupervised learning tasks, i.e., text mining and community detection, to showcase its effectiveness and memory efficiency.","1941-0476","","10.1109/TSP.2022.3177845","Army Research Office(grant numbers:ARO W911NF19-1-0407); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9782542","Unsupervised multimodal analysis;sample complexity;identifiability","Signal processing algorithms;Noise measurement;Task analysis;Costs;Convex functions;Noise robustness;Hyperspectral imaging","computational complexity;convex programming;data analysis;data mining;greedy algorithms;matrix decomposition;text analysis;unsupervised learning;vectors","community detection;text mining;unsupervised learning tasks;convex SD-MMV based NMF;smoothed group sparsity regularizer;multiple measurement vector;convex NMF formulation;tractable algorithm design;Frank-Wolfe approach;self-dictionary separable nonnegative matrix factorization;memory-efficient convex optimization;linear memory complexity algorithmic framework;noisy SD-MMV problem;Frank-Wolfe algorithm;memory cost;convex programming;greedy pursuit;separability-based NMF","","2","","55","IEEE","26 May 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

There are two challenges for ensuring the Qos of the data-intensive services. Firstly, besides performance, reliability is another important concern especially for some critical applications, which remains unexplored. Secondly, data compression has to be involved for reducing the heavy workload of wireless communications at the edge of the network. To overcome these challenges, this paper jointly studies the reliability-aware data compression and task offloading for data-intensive applications in MEC. Markov models are constructed to capture the dynamics of the state transitions of MEC systems, and quantitative analyses are conducted for performance and reliability evaluation. For fully taking advantages of data compression in QoS guarantee, we formulate an optimization problem with the objective of minimizing latency while satisfying constraints on reliability and energy consumption. After describing the NP-Hardness of the problem, we apply the techniques of problem linearization and constraint relaxation, transform the original problem into a convex optimization problem. Then, the problem can be solved in a parallel way by introducing the Alternating Direction Multiplier Method (ADMM), and a distributed Reliability-aware Task Processing and Offloading (RTPO) algorithm is presented.

Big data analytics systems, however, still lack the ability to take task objectives such as user performance goals and budgetary constraints and automatically configure an analytic job to achieve these objectives. This paper presents UDAO, a Spark-based Unified Data Analytics Optimizer that can automatically determine a cluster configuration with a suitable number of cores as well as other system parameters that best meet the task objectives. At a core of our work is a principled multi-objective optimization (MOO) approach that computes a Pareto optimal set of configurations to reveal tradeoffs between different objectives, recommends a new Spark configuration that best explores such tradeoffs, and employs novel optimizations to enable such recommendations within a few seconds. Detailed experiments using benchmark workloads show that our MOO techniques provide a 2-50× speedup over existing MOO methods, while offering good coverage of the Pareto frontier. Compared to Ottertune, a state-of-the-art performance tuning system, UDAO recommends Spark configurations that yield 26%-49% reduction of running time of the TPCx-BB benchmark while adapting to different user preferences on multiple objectives.","2375-026X","978-1-7281-9184-3","10.1109/ICDE51399.2021.00041","European Research Council; China Scholarship Council; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9458826","","Data analysis;Pipelines;Benchmark testing;Pareto optimization;Data engineering;Data models;Sparks","benchmark testing;Big Data;cloud computing;data analysis;optimisation;parallel processing;Pareto optimisation;pattern clustering","Spark-based cloud Data Analytics;enterprise businesses;big data analytics systems;task objectives;user performance goals;budgetary constraints;analytic job;UDAO;Spark-based Unified Data Analytics Optimizer;cluster configuration;system parameters;multiobjective optimization approach;Spark configuration that best explores;optimizations;Spark configurations","","3","","41","IEEE","22 Jun 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Recently, graph convolutional neural networks, a combination of CNN and graph representation learning, have shown great potential in the HSI classification problem. However, the existing graph convolution network (GCN)-based methods have many problems, such as overdependence on the adjacency matrix, usage of a single modal feature, and lower accuracy than the mature CNN method. In this article, we propose a feature fusion hypergraph neural network (F2HNN) for HSI classification. F2HNN first generates hyperedges from features of different modalities to construct a hypergraph representing multimodal features in HSI. Then, the HSI and the extracted hypergraph are input into the hypergraph convolutional neural network for learning. In addition, we propose three feature fusion strategies. The first strategy is the most basic spatial and spectral feature fusion. The second strategy fuses the spectral features extracted by a pretrained multilayer perceptron (MLP) with the spatial features to reduce the redundant information of the original spectral features. The third strategy uses the fusion of CNN features, spectral features, and spatial features to explore the capabilities of F2HNN. Sufficient experiments on four datasets have proved the effectiveness of F2HNN.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2021.3123423","National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2019YFC1510905); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9590574","Deep learning;feature fusion;graph convolution networks (GCNs);hypergraph learning;hyperspectral image (HSI) classification","Feature extraction;Convolution;Task analysis;Deep learning;Convolutional neural networks;Hyperspectral imaging;Data mining","feature extraction;geophysical image processing;graph theory;hyperspectral imaging;image classification;image fusion;learning (artificial intelligence);multilayer perceptrons;neural nets","2 HNN;hyperspectral image classification;feature fusion hypergraph convolution neural network;convolution neural networks;representation learning;convolutional neural networks;HSI classification problem;existing graph convolution network-based methods;single modal feature;mature CNN method;feature fusion hypergraph neural network;multimodal features;extracted hypergraph;hypergraph convolutional neural network;fusion strategies;spectral feature fusion;spatial features;original spectral features;CNN features","","2","","49","IEEE","27 Oct 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Moreover, it allows us to better understand the company's flows, either to help in decision-making or to improve its Manufacturing Planning. In the context of Supply Chain Management 4.0 (SCM 4.0), we have chosen modeling tools that allow us to describe the main processes of the Supply Chain (SC), in order to define the needs in terms of performance evaluation, taking into account the static and dynamic specificities linked to the uncertainty of the environment and the digitalization. In fact, the static model describes structural characteristics whereas the dynamic model describes dynamic behavior. The modeling improvement process requires static and dynamic sub-models developed from identical concepts and whose coherence is ensured by interactions between the two models. In our research work, we propose a Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) used to convert the natural language of SC processes into process diagrams with graphical elements. We use tasks and sub-processes are used to depict basic SC plans and functions. Sequence flows to connect activities and present the transitions and path of tasks and plans. We also use Gateways to control the convergence and divergence of paths in SC process diagrams. Message flows display information flows and material flows between SC entities as needed. Thus, we develop a static and dynamic model that represents the SC using a generic modeling approach based on Supply Chain Operations Reference (SCOR) and BPMN.","","979-8-3503-9836-6","10.1109/IRASET57153.2023.10152964","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10152964","Supply Chain Management 4.0;Modeling Systems;Decision-making;BPMN;Processes;SCOR","Performance evaluation;Visualization;Supply chain management;Uncertainty;Supply chains;Decision making;Systems modeling","","","","","","24","IEEE","21 Jun 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, the currently intelligent video surveillance is difficult to respond in real-time due to the latency of cloud computing. In this paper, a cloud-edge cooperation framework is proposed, which integrates cloud computing and edge computing in a coordinated manner. The cloud computing is used to process non-real-time and global tasks, while the edge computing is responsible for handling local monitoring video in real-time. In order to realize cloud-edge data interaction and online optimization for edge models, the heterogeneous converged network is built. In addition, an object detection model FL-YOLO composed of depthwise separable convolution and down-sampling inverted residual block is proposed, which realizes real-time video analysis at the edge. Finally, this paper discusses the complexity of FL-YOLO by its computational cost and model size. The experiment results show that the model size of FL-YOLO is 16.1MB, which is very light, and it achieves 36.7 FPS on NVIDIA Jetson TX1 and an AP of 76.7% on Multi-scene pedestrian dataset. Comparing with mainstream object detection models, FL-YOLO completes faster detection speed and higher accuracy, and it has lower calculation complexity and smaller model scale. Furthermore, the AP on Single-scene pedestrian dataset of FL-YOLO is improved to 80.7% by cloud-edge cooperation. K-Fold method is also used to further compared the performance of FL-YOLO and other models.

The majority of EE algorithms extract only one pure spectrum for each class of material, which may lead to a large unmixing error in cases of spectral variability. Endmember bundle extraction (EBE), which identifies a set of endmembers representing the spectral variability within each class, has been developed to solve the spectral variability problem. To date, only a small number of EBE methods have been developed; moreover, these approaches mainly employ traditional convex-geometry-based EE methods to extract endmember bundles from subset data, which may result in the loss of some endmembers and an incomplete endmember bundle set. This paper proposes an improved multi-objective particle swarm optimization method for the identification of multiple endmember bundles, named IMPSO-EBE. The proposed approach follows the framework of the spatial-spectral EBE (SSEBE) method, which extracts endmember candidates first and then applies post-processing to remove redundant endmembers. However, unlike the SSEBE method, which uses the traditional pixel purity index (PPI) method to obtain candidate endmembers from single feature space, IMPSO-EBE proposes to cooperate across multiple dataspaces to obtain candidate endmembers based on multi-objective particle swarm optimization, making it able to extract candidate endmembers that cannot be identified in single feature space. We compare the performance of the proposed method with that of the single dataspace-based endmember bundle extraction methods using two real hyperspectral datasets. Results show that the endmember bundles identified by the proposed method are more complete than those of the comparison method.","1558-0571","","10.1109/LGRS.2023.3287919","Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(grant numbers:2042023kf0223); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62201622); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10158362","Endmember extraction;Hyperspectral unmixing;Multi-objective optimization;Spectral variability","Optimization;Indexes;Hyperspectral imaging;Linear programming;Data mining;Particle swarm optimization;Feature extraction","","","","","","","IEEE","20 Jun 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

Different from the strategy of minimizing task delay or minimizing power consumption adopted in the existing works of literature, the first algorithm considers both of these two strategies concurrently. The second is proposed to maximize task admission under the constraints of the user device power and system resource. The third is proposed to expand the system resource with the least cost to improve the admission when the system resource is insufficient. The above three are non-deterministic polynomial-time (NP)-hard problems, which will be solved by adopting the strategy of rounding algorithm in this article.

In the cloud services market, service providers attempt to make more profits from their services, while users hope to choose low-cost services with high-quality. The conflict of interests between users and service providers is an important challenge for the booming cloud service market. This article characterizes this application problem formally based on a utility game model of service providers and users. In the model, QoS is considered as the basis for determining the utilities of both parties from an economic point of view. By analyzing the behaviors of users and service providers, we introduce the concept of reputation cost for the first time in the model and find a QoS solution that balances the utilities of users and service providers in service transactions. In such a balance, any change in either party's strategy will result in a loss of utility. And then a QoS optimization method is designed to obtain a near-optimal QoS solution for a tradeoff between user satisfaction and provider profit. Extensive simulation experiments are conducted to substantiate the effectiveness of our method.

However, conventional compression methods can hardly be applied to GANs due to the training process and optimization target of GANs are different from the traditional classification detection network. Inspired by the recent success of knowledge distillation, we condense the recent researches on them applied to particular GANs, i.e. WGAN and CGAN for special tasks into two strategies: Soft Target Only Strategy (STOS) and Inherited Hard Target Strategy (IHTS), and propose an novel Random Hard Target Strategy, namely RHTS. In RHTS, we take the student network generator loss as the hard target of knowledge distillation when the discriminator is fixed, and the output of the teacher network generator as the soft target to distill GANs.

A pretty, simple light bulb that is connected through short‐range radio signals and can follow simple instructions remotely can very well be considered part of an IoT network. In some sense, the IoT is no exception to this general trend. Automating the process of continuously monitoring the reading of the device is a mundane task. More sophisticated equipment may need diverse instrumentation and rich and multivariate analytics on data for a reliable detection. The major benefit of IoT systems is what we like to call the transportability of learning. A lot needs to happen technologically before a truly connected system becomes operational.

Whereas data scientists utilize algorithmic models in order to transform datasets and extract actionable knowledge, a key challenge is oriented towards abstracting the underline layers: the ones enabling the management of infrastructure resources and the ones responsible to provide frameworks and components as services. In this sense, the serverless approach features as the novel paradigm of new cloud-related technology, enabling the agile implementation of applications and services. The concept of Function as a Service (FaaS) is introduced as a revolutionary model that offers the means to exploit serverless offerings. Developers have the potential to design their applications with the necessary scalability in the form of nanoservices without addressing themselves the way the infrastructure resources should be deployed and managed. By abstracting away the underlying hardware allocations, the data scientist concentrates on the business logic and critical problems of Machine Learning (ML) algorithms. This paper introduces an approach to realize the provision of ML Functions as a Service (i.e., ML-FaaS), by exploiting the Apache OpenWhisk event-driven, distributed serverless platform. The presented approach tackles also composite services that consist of single ones i.e., workflows of ML tasks including processes such as aggregation, cleaning, feature extraction, and analytics; thus, reflecting the complete data path.

Since the huge business and research value behind the large-scale data, big data technology has become one of the hotest research fields in academia and industry. To the big data, storing and processing the data is core function of the file systems. Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) is the most typical distributed big data architecture, which has the characteristics of high reliability, high fault tolerance, and low hardware cost. HDFS provides the efficient task implementation and fault tolerance among nodes by Remote Procedure Call (RPC) mechanism. However, the traditional RPC mechanism has remarkable defects with the fixed timing method, and cannot quickly establish the relationship between node downtime and network congestion. In this paper, we propose an improved adaptive RPC mechanism for node fault tolerance and performance. The proposed method classifies nodes by the data block access statistic, and dynamically adjusts the RPC interval time. This method can be used to reduce the networking traffic and processing pressure of NameNode nodes, and improve the I/O and task performance. Through the node classification, an inrack method is used to achieve better performance on fault tolerance. Eventually, we design the extensive experiments to evaluate the proposed method, and experimental results show it improves the performance compared with state-of-the-art method.","","979-8-3503-1993-4","10.1109/HPCC-DSS-SmartCity-DependSys57074.2022.00270","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62172058); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10074913","Hadoop Distributed File System;Remote Procedure Call;Task Performance;Fault Tolerance","Industries;Fault tolerance;Adaptive systems;Heart beat;File systems;System performance;Fault tolerant systems","Big Data;distributed databases;fault tolerant computing;optimisation;parallel processing;remote procedure calls;storage management","adaptive RPC mechanism;big data technology;distributed big data architecture;Hadoop distributed file system;HDFS;high fault tolerance;information technologies;low hardware cost;NameNode nodes;node classification;node fault tolerance optimization;remote procedure call mechanism;RPC interval time","","","","15","IEEE","28 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, since the industrial process of ICPS is always complicated and large scale, the raw data only contain a few operation condition information, which brings challenges to process monitoring and control. Thus, an efficient operation condition division method for ICPS is necessary. Although many operation condition division methods have been proposed, they were mainly relying on the static characteristics and ignored how the industrial process varies dynamically. Meanwhile, with the industrial process running, there may exist some new operation conditions that make the operation condition division task even more difficult. In order to grasp the static and dynamic features simultaneously of the industrial process and divide operation conditions accurately, we proposed an operation condition division method based on joint static and dynamic analysis with incremental learning. In detail, the slow feature analysis (SFA) and self-organizing map (SOM) network were proposed to extract the static and dynamic features jointly. Then, a division strategy was proposed to distinguish the operation condition changing points. For the new operating condition, we designed an incremental learning method based on the SOM network, which can update the operation condition model in real time. Extensive experiments, including a numerical simulation, two benchmark processes, and an industrial roasting process demonstrate that the proposed method can identify the operation conditions of the raw data in ICPS accurately and efficiently.","2327-4662","","10.1109/JIOT.2021.3078330","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62073340,61860206014); National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2019YFB1705300,2019YFB1705300); Innovation-Driven Plan in Central South University, China(grant numbers:2019CX020); 111 Project, China(grant numbers:B17048); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9425548","Incremental learning;industrial cyber–physical system (ICPS);operation condition division;static and dynamic analysis","Feature extraction;Self-organizing feature maps;Internet of Things;Data mining;Process control;Indexes;Clustering methods","condition monitoring;learning (artificial intelligence);mineral processing industry;process control;process monitoring;self-organising feature maps","dynamic analysis;dynamic features;efficient operation condition division method;incremental learning method;industrial cyber-physical systems;industrial insight;industrial process;industrial roasting process;joint static analysis;operating condition;operation condition changing points;operation condition division task;operation condition information;operation condition model;operation conditions;raw data;static features","","4","","40","IEEE","7 May 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In wireless metropolitan area networks (WMANs), edges can better provide computing services via advanced communication technologies. For improving the Quality-of-Service (QoS), edges need to be collaborated rather than working alone. However, the existing solutions of multi-edge collaboration solely adopt a centralized or decentralized decision-making way of load balancing, making it hard to achieve the optimal result because the local and global conditions are not jointly considered. To solve this problem, we propose a novel Two-stage Decision-making method of load Balancing for multi-Edge Collaboration (TDB-EC). First, the centralized decision-making is executed with global information, where a deep neural networks (DNN) based prediction model is designed to evaluate the range of task scheduling between adjacent edges. Next, considering the global condition of load balancing, the decentralized decision-making is executed with local information, where a deep Q-networks (DQN) based Q-value prediction model of adjustment operations is developed to evaluate the load balancing plan among edges. Finally, the objective load balancing plan is obtained via feedback-control.

For the resource-limited IoT devices, offloading computation-intensive tasks (blockchain verification and mining tasks, and data process tasks) to edge servers for execution is considered as a promising solution in mobile-edge computing. However, conventional methods (such as linear programming or game theory) for the computation offloading problem cannot achieve long-term performance while the existing deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based algorithms suffer from slow convergence, lack of robustness, and unstable performance. In this article, we propose a multiagent DRL framework to achieve long-term performance for cooperative computation offloading, in which a scatter network is adopted to improve its stability and league learning is introduced for agents to explore the environment collaboratively for fast convergence and robustness. First, we study the nonorthogonal multiple access-enabled cooperative computation offloading problem and formulate the joint problem as a Markov decision process by considering both the blockchain mining tasks and data processing tasks. Second, to avoid useless exploration and unstable performance, we initially train an intelligent agent represented by scatter networks using conventional expert strategies. Third, in order to enhance the performance, we subsequently establish a hierarchical league where agents collaborate with others to explore the environment. Finally, our experimental results demonstrate that our algorithm could perform better in terms of reducing energy cost and delay cost, and shortening almost 60% of the training time compared with the state-of-the-art approaches.","2327-4662","","10.1109/JIOT.2020.3016644","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61803096,61722304,61703113,61727810); Science and Technology Plan Project of Guangzhou(grant numbers:202002030289); Key Areas of Research and Development Plan Project of Guangdong(grant numbers:2019B010147001); Major Research Project on Industry Technology of Guangzhou(grant numbers:201902020014); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9167270","Blockchain;cooperative computation offloading;deep reinforcement learning (DRL);edge computing","Internet of Things;Intelligent agents;Heuristic algorithms;Task analysis;Convergence;Training","blockchains;cloud computing;game theory;Internet of Things;learning (artificial intelligence);linear programming;Markov processes;mobile computing;multi-agent systems","fast convergence;robustness;nonorthogonal multiple access-enabled;Markov decision process;blockchain mining tasks;data processing tasks;NOMA-enabled cooperative computation offloading;league learning;stability;scatter network;multiagent DRL framework;unstable performance;deep reinforcement learning-based algorithms;computation offloading problem;linear programming;mobile-edge computing;data process tasks;blockchain verification;computation-intensive tasks;IoT;blockchain technologies;learning approach;blockchain-empowered Internet","","38","","38","IEEE","14 Aug 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In industrial applications, multi-objective topology optimization requires expensive simulations to evaluate the objectives and generate multiple Pareto-optimal solutions. So, it is more economical to identify preferred regions on the Pareto front and generate only the desired solutions. Clustering methods, a widely used subclass of machine learning methods, provide an unsupervised approach to summarize the dataset, which eases the identification of the preferred set of designs. However, generating solutions similar to the preferred designs based on different metrics is a challenging task. In this paper, we present an interactive method to generate designs similar to a preferred set using one of the state-of-the-art weighted-sum approaches called scaled energy weighting - hybrid cellular automata (SEW-HCA). To avoid unnecessary computations, metamodels are used to predict the desired weight vectors needed by SEW-HCA. We evaluate an application of our method for cooperative topology optimization using a cantilever multi-load-case problem and a crashworthiness optimization problem. Using the proposed method, we could successfully generate designs that are similar to preferred solutions based on geometry and performance. We believe that this is a crucial component that will improve the usefulness of multi-objective topology optimization in real-world applications.","","978-1-6654-6708-7","10.1109/CEC55065.2022.9870326","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9870326","multi-objective optimization;topology optimization;similarity measures;data mining;geometric processing","Measurement;Geometry;Automata;Machine learning;Sampling methods;Computer crashes;Product design","computational geometry;design engineering;Pareto optimisation;structural engineering computing;topology;unsupervised learning","preferred designs;crashworthiness optimization problem;multiple Pareto-optimal solutions;LS-DYNA commercial software;geometrical structure;structural design optimization;cooperative multiobjective topology optimization;clustering methods;machine learning;unsupervised approach;interactive method;scaled energy weighting hybrid cellular automata;SEW-HCA;metamodeling;cantilever multi-load-case problem","","","","27","IEEE","6 Sep 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

While one way to do this is to use standard exploratory data analysis techniques such as clustering or dimensionality reduction, here we propose a different approach, which can be used if we have access to a labeled dataset. The idea is to use sparse oblique decision trees, a type of interpretable model having the structure of a decision tree but where the decision nodes use hyperplanes involving few input features. Such trees can be trained using the Tree Alternating Optimization (TAO) algorithm. Our approach is to train a sparse oblique tree that is as small and sparse as possible while achieving a good enough predictive accuracy, and then to inspect the weights in the tree decision nodes in order to establish a relationship between input features and classes. This reveals interesting patterns about the classifier and about the data itself. For example, we determine how small, specific subsets of features are used for specific classes (say, certain words for certain document topics), both globally or for a single input instance. The hierarchical structure of the tree also explains the common theme among a group of instances. We demonstrate this using the AG news dataset.","2161-4407","978-1-7281-8671-9","10.1109/IJCNN55064.2022.9891903","NSF(grant numbers:IIS-2007147); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9891903","interpretability;text classification;text mining;decision trees","Dimensionality reduction;Sentiment analysis;Neural networks;Feature extraction;Prediction algorithms;Decision trees;Data mining","data analysis;data mining;decision trees;learning (artificial intelligence);natural language processing;pattern classification;pattern clustering;text analysis","standard exploratory data analysis techniques;clustering;labeled dataset;sparse oblique decision trees;decision tree;decision nodes;Tree Alternating Optimization algorithm;sparse oblique tree;tree decision;AG news dataset;interpret natural language processing datasets;document classification;high-dimensional feature vectors;bag-of-words approaches;data mining","","","","42","IEEE","30 Sep 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, most of the current dictionary learning strategies can only be used for single-frame image separately, which are insufficient from the perspective of incremental information acquisition and global optimization for the sequential or multiframe satellite images. To this end, this article proposes an incremental dictionary learning method for multiframe satellite images representation in the spectral domain. The incremental dictionary learning is formulated analytically in the framework of sparse representation with low-rank constraint, as a frame-by-frame gradual optimization process of global and local dictionaries, and their corresponding sparse coefficients with the sequence. Specifically, the global dictionary representing the common spectral information of the sequential frames is optimized by two adjacent frames gradually. Meanwhile, the local dictionary representing the specific spectral information of each frame is optimized by the newly added frame itself. In addition, an activity ratio for separating the global dictionary from the local dictionaries, an outlier detection method for initializing the local dictionary are also given, and the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMMs) is employed to implement the above optimization. Comparison results with the related state-of-the-art methods on different datasets demonstrate that, our proposed method achieves the best representation performance in both spatial and spectral domains, and also helps to improve the performance of dictionary-based tasks using sequential satellite images, such as sea surface anomaly detection.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2022.3173936","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:41971294); China Postdoctoral Science Foundation(grant numbers:2020M680560); Cross-Media Intelligent Technology Project of Beijing National Research Center for Information Science and Technology (BNRist) of China(grant numbers:BNR2019TD01022); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9771430","Global dictionary;gradual optimization;incremental learning;local dictionary;multiframe images;sparse and low-rank constraints","Dictionaries;Machine learning;Optimization;Sparse matrices;Image representation;Satellites;Matrices","dictionaries;image classification;image motion analysis;image representation;image sequences;learning (artificial intelligence);video signal processing","global dictionary;common spectral information;sequential frames;local dictionary;specific spectral information;newly added frame;representation performance;dictionary-based tasks;sequential satellite images;multiframe satellite image representation;current dictionary learning strategies;single-frame image;incremental information acquisition;global optimization;incremental dictionary learning method;multiframe satellite images representation;sparse representation;frame-by-frame gradual optimization process","","1","","75","IEEE","10 May 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

At the same time, data on part participants show imbalanced or even miss some classes, further increasing the difficulty of solving this kind of problem. In view of this, by introducing a trusted third party to process and integrate optimal information from participants, this paper proposes a multi-participant federated evolutionary feature selection algorithm for imbalanced data under privacy protection. Firstly, a multi-level joint sample filling strategy with multiple participants (called sampling-rough selection-fine tuning strategy) is proposed to fill imbalanced or empty classes on each participant while ensuring data privacy. Then, a federated evolutionary feature selection method based on particle swarm optimization (PSO) is proposed by periodically sharing the optimal feature subsets obtained by PSOs on participants. Finally, the proposed algorithm is applied to 15 test datasets, and compared with several typical imbalanced feature selection algorithms and two kinds of ensemble feature selection algorithms.

Incompleteness in data raises many issues such as compromise on transitivity property and the threat of cyclic dominance to occur within database. To overcome such issues this paper proposes an efficient algorithm called Cloud-based Incomplete Data Skyline algorithm (CIDS) for processing skyline queries over partially complete databases in cloud environment.

Typically, cyber–physical environments consist of a number of mobile devices that are potentially able to establish opportunistic contacts and serve mobile applications in a cost-effective way. Opportunistic mobile service computing is a promising paradigm capable of utilizing the pervasive mobile computational resources around the users. Mobile users are thus allowed to exploit nearby mobile services to boost their computing capabilities without investment in their resource pool. Nevertheless, various challenges, especially its quality-of-service and reliability-aware scheduling, are yet to be addressed. Existing studies and related scheduling strategies consider mobile users to be fully stable and available. In this article, we propose a novel method for reliability-aware and deadline-constrained service composition over opportunistic networks. We leverage the Krill–Herd-based algorithm to yield a deadline-constrained, reliability-aware, and well-executable service composition schedule based on the estimation of completion time and reliability of schedule candidates. We carry out extensive case studies based on some well-known mobile service composition templates and a real-world opportunistic contact data set. The comparison results suggest that the proposed approach outperforms existing ones in terms of success rate and completion time of composed services. Note to Practitioners—Recently, the rapid development of mobile devices and mobile communication leads to the prosperity of mobile service computing. Services running on mobile devices within a limited range are allowed to be composed to coordinate through wireless communication technologies and perform complex tasks and business processes. Despite its great potential, mobile service compositions remains a challenge since the mobility of users and devices imposes high unpredictability on the execution of tasks. A careful investigation into existing methods has found their various limitations, e.g., assuming time-invariant availability of mobile services. This article presents a novel reliability-aware and deadline-constrained service composition method for mobile opportunistic networks. Instead of assuming time-invariant availability of mobile nodes, the proposed method is capable of estimating service availability at run-time and leveraging a Krill–Herd-based algorithm to yield the deadline-constrained, reliability-aware, and well-executable service composition schedules. Case studies based on well-known service composition templates and real-world data sets suggest that it outperforms traditional ones in terms of success and completion time of composed services. It can thus aid the design and optimization of composite services as well as their smooth execution in a mobile environment. It can help practitioners better manage the reliability and performance of real-world applications built upon mobile services.","1558-3783","","10.1109/TASE.2020.2993218","NSFC(grant numbers:61472051,61772493); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(grant numbers:2019CDXYJSJ0022); Natural Science Foundation of Chongqing (China)(grant numbers:cstc2019jcyjjqX0013); Universities’ Sci-tech Achievements Transformation Project of Chongqing(grant numbers:KJZH17104); Chongqing Research Program of Technology Innovation and Application(grant numbers:cstc2017rgznzdyfX0020,cstc2017zdcy-zdyf0554,cstc2017rgzn-zdyf0118); Chongqing Cultivation Program of Innovation and Entrepreneurship Demonstration Group(grant numbers:cstc2017kjrc-cxcytd0149); Chongqing Overseas Scholars Innovation Program(grant numbers:cx2017012,cx2018011); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9106793","Intelligent optimization;Krill–Herd algorithm;mobile computing;mobile opportunistic network;mobile service composition;service reliability","Reliability;Mobile computing;Device-to-device communication;Service computing;Quality of service;Optimization","mobile communication;mobile computing;optimisation;scheduling;smart phones;telecommunication computing;Web services","opportunistic mobile service computing;pervasive mobile computational resources;quality-of-service;reliability-aware scheduling;Krill-Herd-based algorithm;completion time;mobile communication;time-invariant availability;mobile opportunistic networks;mobile nodes;cyber-physical environments;business processes;deadline-constrained mobile service composition method;service composition schedule;service composition templates;wireless communication technologies;real-world opportunistic contact data set","","13","","68","IEEE","2 Jun 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Our solution involves a reformation of the objective function for stochastic optimization in neural network models, along with a novel parallel computing strategy, coined the weighted aggregating stochastic gradient descent (WASGD). Following a theoretical analysis on the characteristics of the new objective function, WASGD introduces a decentralized weighted aggregating scheme based on the performance of local workers. Without any center variable, the new method automatically gauges the importance of local workers and accepts them by their contributions. Furthermore, we have developed an enhanced version of the method, WASGD+, by (1) implementing a designed sample order and (2) upgrading the weight evaluation function. To validate the new method, we benchmark our pipeline against several popular algorithms including the state-of-the-art deep neural network classifier training techniques (e.g., elastic averaging SGD).

We present a hybrid model that combines topic modeling using latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) and word embeddings to obtain external knowledge from structured and unstructured data. We use a topic model to extract topic- and sentence-specific evidence from the structured knowledge base Wikidata. A knowledge graph is constructed based on the cosine similarity between the entity word vectors of Wikidata and the vector of the given sentence.

These include the implementation of the right organizational structure and avoid project schedule delays to achieve projects’ success. Unfortunately, the classification of significant project success dimensions in the R&D environment is still an elusive concept. This study adopts a multi-dimensional qualitative and quantitative approach to explore the critical dimensions of organizational structure and schedule management that enhance or hinder the project success in R&D organizations. In Phase 1, a Delphi Study is conducted, results of reliability and other tests are the input of Phase 2. On the basis of these tests, variables have been selected for the next phase or final questionnaire. In Phase 2, through a survey of 285 responses in a R&D environment, the proposed framework is validated by conducting face, content and construct validity. The results indicated that formalization, specialization, differentiation, coordination mechanism, decentralization and authority of managers have a significant effect on the schedule management and successful execution of R&D projects; whereas, centralization and departmentalization do not correlate strongly. The results also imply that decentralized organizational structures (organic) are more preferable than centralized structures (mechanistic) for the execution of R&D projects when proposed timelines are to be met timely. The proposed framework will act as a supporting mechanism for engineering managers to deal with organizational structure and schedule management factors in a highly uncertain R&D environment where projects deviate frequently from their anticipated timeline.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3112112","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9536503","Organizational Structure;Project Success;Project Management;R&D Environment;R&D Projects;Schedule Management;The Delphi Study","Research and development;Schedules;Organizations;Uncertainty;Delays;Project management;Task analysis","forecasting theory;organisational aspects;project management;research and development;scheduling","critical dimensions;R&D environment;Delphi study;validation techniques;organizational structure;project success dimensions;schedule management factors","","","","149","CCBY","13 Sep 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Opinion Mining (OM) deals with classifying and identifying opinion expressed by the students. The requirement of OM is to understand and analyse dissimilar behaviour of different personality which is a collection of extracted information from various resources. A solution to analyse cognitive behaviour of students based on the OM is a Natural Language Processing (NLP) and task of extracting information which discovers user's opinion interpreted in terms of positive or negative comments. The OM has played an important role in cognizing the emotional and intellectual behavior of university student through social media which may either be accomplished with viable or untenable education. Machine Learning (ML) algorithm helps to find the accuracy of polarity present in the OM. The Support Vector Machine (SVM) has shown better accuracy which is 93% through OM on the analysis of intellectual behavior for the student based on their knowledge and learning methodology.","","978-93-80544-43-4","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9441195","Opinion Mining;Intellectual Behaviour;Brain Dominance;Machine Learning","Support vector machines;Sentiment analysis;Machine learning algorithms;Social networking (online);Education;Machine learning;Planning","cognition;computer aided instruction;data mining;learning (artificial intelligence);natural language processing;social networking (online);support vector machines;text analysis","students feedback;intellectual behavior;OM;identifying opinion;analyse dissimilar behaviour;analyse cognitive behaviour;emotional behavior;university student;intellectual behaviour;education data determined;opinion mining;individual thought process;thoughts learning","","","","26","","3 Jun 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Duchi et al. recently proposed a private sampling strategy to solve privacy leakage in stochastic optimization. However, this strategy leads to a degeneration in robustness, since this strategy is equal to noise injection on each gradient, which adversely affects updates of the primal variable. To address this challenge, we introduce a robust stochastic optimization under the framework of local privacy, which is called Privacy-pREserving StochasTIc Gradual lEarning (PRESTIGE). PRESTIGE bridges private updates of the primal variable (by private sampling) with gradual curriculum learning (CL). The noise injection leads to similar issue from label noise, but the robust learning process of CL can combat with label noise. Thus, PRESTIGE yields “private but robust” updates of the primal variable on the curriculum, that is, a reordered label sequence provided by CL. In theory, we reveal the convergence rate and maximum complexity of PRESTIGE. Empirical results on six datasets show that PRESTIGE achieves a good tradeoff between privacy preservation and robustness over baselines.","1558-2191","","10.1109/TKDE.2020.2963977","ARC(grant numbers:LP150100671,DP180100106,DP200101328); MOE, Singapore(grant numbers:MOE2015-T2-2-069); NUS, Singapore; ARC(grant numbers:DP180100966); HKBU Tier-1(grant numbers:HKBU CSD); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8949708","Stochastic optimization;differential privacy;robustness","Privacy;Optimization;Differential privacy;Robustness;Stochastic processes;Task analysis","data handling;data privacy;gradient methods;learning (artificial intelligence);optimisation;sampling methods;stochastic processes","private sampling strategy;privacy leakage;noise injection;robust stochastic optimization;local privacy;PRESTIGE;gradual curriculum learning;label noise;robust learning process;privacy-preservation stochastic gradual learning;large-scale sensitive data handling","","1","","58","IEEE","3 Jan 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Few studies have focused on the impact of sample-specificity in person search datasets for training a fine-grain Re-ID model, and few have considered obtaining discriminative Re-ID features from Bboxes in a more efficient way. In this paper, a novel sample-enhanced and instance-sensitive (SEIE) framework is designed to boost performance. By analyzing the structure of person search framework, our method refines the two stages separately. For the detection stage, we re-design the usage of Bbox and a sample enhancement combination is proposed to further enhance the quality and quantity of Bboxes. SEC can suppress false positive detection results and randomly generate high-quality positive samples. For the Re-ID stage, we contribute an instance similarity loss to exploit the similarity between classless instances, and an Omni-scale Re-ID backbone is employed to learn more discriminative features. We obtain a more efficient and discriminative person search framework by concatenating the two stages.

In this paper, we proposed a feature aggregation module (FAM) to enhance the correlation between local features including spatial dependencies and channel dependencies. Furthermore, FAM implements cross-modality feature aggregation on the enhanced features to reduce the cross-modality discrepancy. Moreover, we also proposed near neighbor cross-modality loss (NNCLoss) to mine feature consistency between modalities by constructing a cross-modality near neighbor set, which facilitates feature alignment between two modalities.

We observe that the design process of Transformers (pre-train a foundation model on a large dataset in a self-supervised manner, and subsequently fine-tune it for different downstream tasks) leads to task-specific models that are highly over-parameterized, adversely impacting both accuracy and inference efficiency. We propose AxFormer, a systematic framework that applies accuracy-driven approximations to create optimized transformer models for a given downstream task. AxFormer combines two key optimizations — accuracy-driven pruning and selective hard attention. Accuracy-driven pruning identifies and removes parts of the fine-tuned transformer that hinder performance on the given downstream task. Sparse hard-attention optimizes attention blocks in selected layers by eliminating irrelevant word aggregations, thereby helping the model focus only on the relevant parts of the input. In effect, AxFormer leads to models that are more accurate, while also being faster and smaller. Our experiments on GLUE and SQUAD tasks show that AxFormer models are up to 4.5% more accurate, while also being up to 2.5× faster and up to 3.2× smaller than conventional fine-tuned models. In addition, we demonstrate that AxFormer can be combined with previous efforts such as distillation or quantization to achieve further efficiency gains.

FS is a preprocessing approach that has been highly fruitful in medical applications, as it not only reduces dimensionality but also allows us to understand the origins of an illness. Wrappers are computationally expensive but have excellent classification performance, whereas filters are recognized as quick techniques, although they are less accurate. This study presents an advanced binary multi-objective chimp optimization method based on the hybridization of filter and wrapper for the FS task using two archives. In exceptional instances, the initial ChOA version becomes stuck at the local optima. As a result, a novel ChOA termed EBMOChOA is developed here by integrating the Harris Hawk Optimization (HHO) into the original ChOA to improve the optimizer’s search capabilities and broaden the usage sectors. The location change step in the ChOA optimizer is separated into three parts: modifying the population using HHO to produce an HHO-based population; creating hybrid entities according to HHO-based and ChOA-based individuals; and altering the search agent in the light of greedy technique and ChOA’s tools. The effectiveness of the EBMOChOA-FW is proven by comparing it to five other well-known algorithms on nine different benchmark datasets.

Our motivation is to obtain a deeper understanding of users’ decisions regarding applications and their underlying justifications, e.g., why users give ratings or recommendations. These information abstractions can benefit app developers, especially in planning app updates, by providing data-driven requirements from users’ points of view. We utilized a supervised learning approach and built a machine-based annotator to set the ground truth. Seven classifiers and different feature configurations were trained and evaluated on two app review datasets.

It is defined as the drone scheduling problem (DSP). The effectiveness of precise algorithms and heuristic algorithms in solving DSP has been reported in previous studies. In previous studies, the speed of the vessel was assumed to be constant. However, since the influence of sea waves and vessel power, such an assumption is difficult to satisfy in actual scenarios. The actual position of the vessel may deviate from the position information obtained through prior calculations. As the cumulative position deviation increases, it is possible to make the original feasible monitoring scheme infeasible. It is necessary to consider the emission monitoring dispatching of drones under vessel speed fluctuation in actual monitoring activities of the vessel. To deal with the problem, a dynamic dispatching strategy based on reinforcement learning (RL) is proposed. Considering the vessel speed fluctuation, the monitoring window is divided into multiple sub-time windows. The route information of the vessel in each sub-time window is updated according to the vessel speed fluctuations to reduce the accumulation of deviations between the prior position and the actual position. Then, a lightweight RL strategy is adopted to quickly (re)organize the monitoring scheme in each sub-time window. Numerical experiments illustrate the above division-conquer approach could effectively reduce the possibility of drone monitoring failure caused by vessel speed fluctuations. Also, the superiority of the RL-based dispatching strategy is illustrated by comparing it with multiple dispatching schemes.","1558-0016","","10.1109/TITS.2022.3189979","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62171274,U1933125); National Natural Science Foundation of China through the Main Research Project on Machine Behavior and Human–Machine Collaborated Decision Making Methodology(grant numbers:72192820); Third Research Project on Human Behavior in Human–Machine Collaboration(grant numbers:72192822); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9852814","Drone scheduling problem;emission control area;dynamic optimization problem;reinforcement learning","Monitoring;Drones;Dispatching;Sun;Task analysis;Regulation;Sulfur","autonomous aerial vehicles;dispatching;learning (artificial intelligence);optimisation;scheduling","actual monitoring activities;actual position;cumulative position deviation;drone monitoring failure;drone scheduling problem;DSP;dynamic dispatching strategy;emission monitoring dispatching;lightweight RL strategy;original feasible monitoring scheme;port management;position information;reinforcement learning;sea waves;vessel power;vessel speed fluctuation","","2","","42","IEEE","9 Aug 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We add a new mechanism for the distributed constraint optimization problem (DCOP) algorithm to the RRS simulator and confirm its effectiveness by improving the binary max-sum. Agents can communicate only once within each simulation timestep in the RRS, which adopts synchronous simulation. Therefore, it is difficult to apply the DCOP algorithm because it requires repeated communication to derive a solution. Hence, we introduce a pseudo-communication module to the RRS system in this paper so that the DCOP algorithm can be used on the RRS simulator. This module provides the function of processing many message passings among agents in each simulation timestep. RMAS-Bench, which is a similar approach, agents are not affected by partial situational awareness and communication range limitations. However, our module allows the evaluation of the DCOP algorithm in such scenarios. Additionally, we apply binary max-sum_ADVP, which is an improvement of the binary max-sum, to the RRS using our module. Finally, we confirm the effectiveness of the module by studying binary max-sum ADVP on RRS. The results confirmed the effectiveness of our pseudocommunication module; binary max-sum ADVP converged to a better solution than the binary max-sum.

In this paper, to the best of our knowledge, we initiate the first systematic investigation of data poisoning attack on the pairwise ranking algorithms, which can be generally formalized as the dynamic and static games between the ranker and the attacker, and can be modeled as certain kinds of integer programming problems mathematically. To break the computational hurdle of the underlying integer programming problems, we reformulate them into the distributionally robust optimization (DRO) problems, which are computational tractable. Based on such DRO formulations, we propose two efficient poisoning attack algorithms and establish the associated theoretical guarantees including the existence of Nash equilibrium and the generalization ability bounds. The effectiveness of the suggested poisoning attack strategies is demonstrated by a series of toy simulations and several real data experiments. These experimental results show that the proposed methods can significantly reduce the performance of the ranker in the sense that the correlation between the true ranking list and the aggregated results with toxic data can be decreased dramatically.","1939-3539","","10.1109/TPAMI.2021.3087514","National Key R&D Program of China(grant numbers:2018AAA0102003); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61931008,62025604,U1936208,61620106009,61836002,61977038,61976202,62006217); Thousand Talents Plan of Jiangxi Province(grant numbers:jxsq2019201124); Youth Innovation Promotion Association CAS; Strategic Priority Research Program of Chinese Academy of Sciences(grant numbers:XDB28000000); China Postdoctoral Science Foundation(grant numbers:2021T140653,2020M680651); Fundamental Research Funds for Central Universities; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9448491","Adversarial learning;poisoning attack;pairwise comparison;rank aggregation;robust game;distributionally robust optimization","Optimization;Heuristic algorithms;Sports;Voting;Uncertainty;Games;Data models","computer network security;decision theory;game theory;information retrieval;integer programming;learning (artificial intelligence);optimisation;sport","suggested poisoning attack strategies;data experiments;ranking list;toxic data;pairwise comparisons;sports competitions;information retrieval;strong motivation;incentives;malicious comparisons;training data;target ranking algorithm;regression;classification tasks;pairwise ranking algorithms;dynamic games;static games;underlying integer programming problems;distributionally robust optimization problems;efficient poisoning attack algorithms","Algorithms","3","","79","IEEE","8 Jun 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Furthermore, the diversity of distortions in images result in the generalization problem of NR-IQA models when trained with known distortions and tested on unseen distortions, which is an easy task for human. Hence, we propose a NR-IQA metric via deep meta-learning, which is highly generalizable in the face of unseen distortions. The fundamental idea is to learn the meta-knowledge shared by human when evaluating the quality of images with diversified distortions. Specifically, we define NR-IQA of different distortions as a series of tasks and propose a task selection strategy to build two task sets, which are characterized by synthetic to synthetic and synthetic to authentic distortions, respectively. Based on these two task sets, an optimization-based meta-learning is proposed to learn the generalized NR-IQA model, which can be directly used to evaluate the quality of images with unseen distortions.

Another problem of existing methods is their inability to follow the Pareto principle which states that items must be Pareto distributed over the ABC classes. To solve these two problems, we propose a semi-supervised explainable approach based on both semi-supervised clustering and explainable artificial intelligence. The semi-supervised technique is used to integrate an intelligent initialization and a constrained clustering process that guides the classification process to lead to Pareto distributed items, whereas explainable artificial intelligence is used to build detailed micro and macro explanations of the inventory classes at the item and the class levels. Application of the proposed approach for the automatic classification of chemical products of a distribution company has shown the effectiveness of the proposed approach in providing accurate, transparent, and well-explained ABC classes.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3272403","University of Jeddah, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia(grant numbers:UJ-21-ICL-3); NSF-EPSCoR-RII Track-1: Kentucky Advanced Manufacturing Partnership for Enhanced Robotics and Structures(grant numbers:IIP-1849213); NSF(grant numbers:DRL-2026584); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10114405","ABC classification;inventory classification;eXplainble Artificial Intelligence (XAI);explainable clustering;SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP);constrained clustering;semi-supervised clustering","Artificial intelligence;Buildings;Classification algorithms;Task analysis;Mathematical models;Decision making;Costs","artificial intelligence;decision making;image classification;inventory management;Pareto distribution;pattern classification;pattern clustering","ABC classes;ABC classification problem;automatic classification;automatic organization;black-box processes;built classes help decision-makers;class levels;classification process;constrained clustering process;different managerial levels;existing ABC classification methods;explainable artificial intelligence;interpretable multicriteria ABC analysis;inventory classes;inventory items;item managerial classes;multicriteria ABC classification;multicriteria nature;Pareto distributed items;rapid organization;semisupervised clustering;semisupervised explainable approach;semisupervised technique","","","","50","CCBYNCND","2 May 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, while reorganizing tasks for newer employees, it should be ensured that the employees have the requisite capabilities of handling the assigned tasks. Furthermore, security constraints forbid any arbitrary assignment of tasks to employees and also enforce major dependencies on other employees who have access to the same tasks. Since Attribute Based Access Control (ABAC) is poised to emerge as the de facto model for specifying access control policies in commercial information systems, we consider organizational policies and constraints to be modeled with ABAC. Given the increasing size and scale of organizations, both in terms of employees and resources that need to be managed, it is crucial that computational solutions are developed to automate the process of employee to task assignment. In this work, we define the Employee Replacement Problem (ERP) which answers the question of whether a given set of employees can be replaced by a smaller set of employees, while ensuring that the desired security constraints are not violated.

At each step, we determine which moment is the best one for the search based on a heuristic indicator. Then, at that moment, locations are searched one by one in descending order of predicted appearing probabilities until a search hit is obtained. We iterate this step until we derive the object's current location. Five searching strategies are compared via experiments.

To explore the WD’s performance limit in terms of achievable computation rate, an optimization problem is formulated by jointly optimizing the time assignment, the power allocation, and the computation frequency under multiple system constraints. Since the problem is nonconvex with no known solution, an efficient solution approach is designed to achieve the  $\epsilon $ -optimal solution, in which the transmit power vector and the computation frequency are jointly optimized with fixed-time assignment, and then, a golden section search (GSS)-based algorithm is designed to find the optimal time assignment. For the case when the FS is with sufficiently strong computation capability, some semiclosed-form results are derived. Numerous results show that our proposed design achieves much higher computation rate than benchmark schemes. Moreover, with the increment of the helping FSs, the achievable computation rate increases while the increasing rate is decreased. Besides, by employing NOMA, the WD’s computation rate is also improved compared with orthogonal multiple access (OMA)-based scheme.

However, faults and failures usually happen during workflow running.

Firstly, we explore the ‘restart policy’ of containers in the Kubernetes architecture, which lays the foundation for our work that adopts the redundancy strategy to ensure workflow operation. Then we consider the cognitive cost based on the fact that users have a cognitive process for different microservices in selecting microservices. Additionally, another optimization goal is the reliability of workflows. On this basis, we design a reasonable reward function in reinforcement learning to generate dynamic strategies. Furthermore, following some generated strategies, our engine will schedule candidate microservices for tasks to execute step by step. A series of experiments on Alibaba and business areas workflows have proven the superior performance of our algorithm.

Achieving online replanning and scaling to large numbers of robots are particularly challenging. In this paper, we present a motion coordination method for multiple robot manipulators with given targets. The approach separates the problem into a global coordination stage and a local trajectory replanning stage. Online reactivity and scalability are achieved by means of coordination in a reduced space and efficient trajectory replanning. We first introduce the method for systems with two robots, then extend it to systems with an arbitrary number of robots. The method determines whether kinematically-feasible and non-interfering trajectories leading all the robots to their targets exist. The approach generates time-efficient trajectories if solutions exist, or provides information for switching targets if solutions cannot be found. We show formally and empirically that the method has low computational overhead and scales quadratically with the number of robots. Experiments are conducted with up to three real 7-DOF robots and up to ten simulated robots. Note to Practitioners—In underground mining, a key process is that of tunneling, i.e., drilling and blasting rock to excavate tunnels that lead to sources of ore. Drilling is carried out by rigs equipped with multiple robotic arms. A key factor affecting the efficiency of tunneling is the time to completion of drilling operations. In current industrial practice, these operations are carried out manually by an operator steering the arms on the drill rig. Time to completion can be drastically reduced if the arms could operate concurrently, intelligently optimizing and coordinating their motions. However, existing methods for multi-arm motion coordination are inadequate, as they fail to cater to one or more of the following real-world constraints: several robot arms work in close proximity and their workspaces are overlapping; task completion times are uncertain due to rock density and drill bit breakage; and contingencies such as unexpected delays in motion or stops sometimes happen. These constraints exist also in other industrial applications, like manufacturing and assembly. This paper proposes a framework which enables multiple high-DOF robot manipulators to safely and efficiently work in a shared workspace. The method allows to adjust robot trajectories while robots move, and is shown to scale well with the number of robots. Motions are generated and adjusted by time-optimal trajectory planning, whose computational overhead is small enough for online operation and benefits task completion efficiency, safety, and productivity. Experiments using three 7-DOF robots suggest that this approach is practically feasible, and simulations with up to 10 robots attest to its scalability.","1558-3783","","10.1109/TASE.2023.3266889","Vinnova Project AutoBoomer through the Automated Drill Planning for Multiple-Boom Rigs in Underground Mining(grant numbers:2018-04622); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10103893","Multi-robot systems;planning;scheduling and coordination;collision avoidance;real-time planning","Robots;Robot kinematics;Collision avoidance;Trajectory;Manipulators;Task analysis;Planning","","","","","","","IEEE","18 Apr 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

This paper proposes XData, a new general-purpose unified processing system for data analysis and machine learning. It is designed to support a variety of operators in a uniform statement, such as data retrieval, data aggregation, and modeling of machine learning. With the mechanism of pipeline and the data processing language (DPL), developers can easily combine multiple processing with SQL-like form to implement end-to-end applications. It also takes advantage of the intermediate results in the pipeline, and automatically optimizes the performance on the logical plan, physical topology, and task executor level.

Serverless applications based on this model are often composed of several fine-grained and ephemeral Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) functions that implement complex business processes via mutual interaction and interaction with Backend-as-a-Services (BaaS) such as databases. FaaS functions suffer from the cold start problem because of the scale to zero instances feature. In this work, we use neural Temporal Point Processes (TPPs) to model function invocations in FaaS compositions. A probability distribution over the time and class of the following invocations for a given history of invocations is predicted using these probabilistic models. The prediction can avoid cold starts by scaling functions in advance and reduce network load by optimizing the function-server assignment. In this regard, we developed a python-based tool called TppFaaS on top of OpenWhisk open-source serverless platform. TppFaaS uses the neural TPPs LogNormMix for modeling the time using a log-normal mixture distribution and TruncNorm for predicting a single value for the time. Furthermore, we built a custom trace data collector for OpenWhisk embedded into TppFaaS and created datasets for multiple FaaS compositions to train and test our models. For datasets without cold starts, the models achieved for most compositions a mean absolute error below 22ms and a percentage of correctly predicted function classes above 94%.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3144078","German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) in the scope of the Software Campus Program; Technical University of Munich (TUM) in the framework of the Open Access Publishing Program; Google Cloud by the Google Cloud Research Credits Program(grant numbers:NH93G06K20KDXH9U); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9684420","Cloud computing;faas;faas composition;function-as-a-service;modeling;serverless computing;temporal point process","FAA;Codes;Load modeling;Containers;Serverless computing;Databases;Computational modeling","cloud computing;data analysis;probability;service-oriented architecture","Backend-as-a-Services;FaaS functions;cold start problem;neural Temporal Point Processes;model function invocations;probabilistic models;cold starts;function-server assignment;python-based tool;TppFaaS;OpenWhisk open-source serverless platform;neural TPPs LogNormMix;log-normal mixture distribution;multiple FaaS compositions;correctly predicted function classes;serverless computing;cloud computing paradigm;business logic;cloud service providers;resource management tasks;serverless applications;complex business processes;fine-grained function-as-a-service;serverless functions invocations modeling","","4","","66","CCBY","18 Jan 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

MUs compete for the shared spectrum and computing resources over time to achieve their distinctive goals. From the perspective of an MU, we deliberately define the age of update to capture the staleness of information from refreshing computation outcomes. Given the system dynamics, we model the interactions among MUs as a stochastic game. In the Nash equilibrium without cooperation, each MU behaves in accordance with the local system states and conjectures. We can hence transform the stochastic game into a single-agent Markov decision process. As another major contribution, we develop an online deep reinforcement learning (RL) scheme that adopts two separate double deep Q-networks to approximate the Q-factor and the post-decision Q-factor, respectively. The deep RL scheme allows each MU to optimize the behaviours with unknown dynamic statistics. Numerical experiments show that our proposed scheme outperforms the baselines in terms of the average utility under various system conditions.","1558-0008","","10.1109/JSAC.2021.3126075","Academy of Finland(grant numbers:319759,319758,317669); Zhejiang Lab Open Program(grant numbers:2021LC0AB06); Okawa Foundation for Information and Telecommunications; G-7 Scholarship Foundation; Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) KAKENHI(grant numbers:19H04092,20H04174,JP18KK0279,JP20H00592); Research Organization of Information and Systems (ROIS) National Institute Informatics (NII) Open Collaborative Research 2021(grant numbers:21FA02); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61731002); Zhejiang Key Research and Development Plan(grant numbers:2019C01002); Academy of Finland 6G Flagship; European Coordinated CHIST-ERA LearningEdge and CONNECT; University of Oulu Infotech NOOR Project; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9605668","Multi-access edge computing;unmanned aerial vehicle;stochastic games;age of update;multi-agent deep reinforcement learning","Task analysis;Servers;Indium phosphide;III-V semiconductor materials;Games;System dynamics;Q-factor","deep learning (artificial intelligence);Markov processes;mobile computing;reinforcement learning;resource allocation;stochastic games","information freshness-aware task offloading;air-ground integrated multiaccess edge computing system;infrastructure provider;business agreement;third-party service provider;subscribed mobile users;computing resources;stochastic game;single-agent Markov decision process;online deep reinforcement learning;computing services;Nash equilibrium;deep Q-networks;Q-factor","","18","","60","IEEE","8 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Particularly, we first formulate the offloading problem with the goal of maximizing the Quality of Experience (QoE) of the users subject to resource constraints. Since each user focuses on maximizing its own QoE, we reformulate the problem as a Multi-User Task Offloading Game (MUTO-Game). We then identify an important property that for any device, both the communication interference and the degree of computing resource competition can be upper bounded. Based on the property, we further theoretically prove that there exists at least one Nash Equilibrium offloading strategy in the MUTO-Game. We propose the Game-based Decentralized Task Offloading (GDTO) approach to obtain the Nash Equilibrium offloading strategy. Finally, we analyze the upper bound for the convergence time and characterize the performance guarantee of the obtained offloading strategy for the worst case.

Most data used for learning analytics research comes from learning management systems. However, such systems were not developed to support learning programming. Therefore, educators have to resort to other systems that support the programming process, which can pose a challenge when it comes to understanding students’ learning since it takes place in different contexts. Methods that support the combination of different data sources are needed. Such methods would ideally account for the time-ordered sequence of students’ learning actions. In this article, we use a novel method (multi-channel sequence mining with Hidden Markov Models, HMMs) that allows the combination of multiple data sources, accounts for the temporal nature of students’ learning actions, and maps the transitions between different learning tactics. Our study included 291 students enrolled in a higher education programming course. Students’ trace-log data were collected from the learning management system and from a programming automated assessment tool. Data were analyzed using multi-channel sequence mining and HMM. The results reveal different patterns of students’ approaches to learning programming. High achievers start earlier to work on the programming assignments, use more independent strategies and consume learning resources more frequently, while the low achievers procrastinate early in the course and rely on help forums. Our findings demonstrate the potentials of multi-channel sequence mining and how this method can be analyzed using HMM. Furthermore, the results obtained can be of use for educators to understand students’ strategies when learning programming.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3134844","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9646931","Learning analytics;programming;computer science education;sequence mining;Hidden Markov Models;automated assessment","Programming profession;Data mining;Soft sensors;Trajectory;Hidden Markov models;Education;Task analysis","computer aided instruction;computer science education;data mining;educational courses;further education;hidden Markov models;teaching","multiple data sources;different learning tactics;higher education programming course;learning management system;programming automated assessment tool;multichannel sequence mining;programming assignments;complex multichannel data;learning analytics study;programming education;learning analytics research;management systems;support learning programming;programming process;understanding students","","8","","47","CCBY","10 Dec 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

As a result, it is more and more sensitive to power consumption and task delay, which poses a severe challenge to edge terminal server. To solve this problem, a task unloading algorithm based on edge terminal server is proposed. Firstly, a directed acyclic graph is constructed according to the distribution characteristics of the edge terminal server in the power distribution station area, and the complete parallelism between the edge terminal server and the equipment in the power distribution station area is established.

Furthermore, in a competitive environment, as the stock market, the time series' non-linearity is pronounced which immediately impacts the performance of stock price forecasting. The stock price prediction models are divided into two scientific parameters, long-term or short-term. The short-term stock forecast relates to stock or future market forecasts for stock prices and trading strategies for a maximum period of several days between entry and departure. The idea behind these parameters is that the result of the prediction should have a higher accuracy rate than long-term predictions, considering that the stock market is highly competitive.

This problem is of fundamental importance to urban traffic management, planning, and various business services. However, predicting urban dynamics is challenging due to the highly dynamic (i.e., varying across geographical locations and evolving over time) and uncertain (i.e., affected by unexpected factors) nature of urban traffic systems. Recent works adopt meta-learning approaches to capture irregular and rare patterns but make unrealistic assumptions such as single-domain uncertainties and explicit temporal task segmentation. In this paper, we solve the urban dynamics prediction problem from the Bayesian meta-learning perspective and propose a novel domain adaptable continuous meta-learning approach (DAC-ML) that does not require task segmentation. Trained on a sequence of spatial-temporal urban dynamics data, DAC-ML aims to detect and infer unobserved latent variations (from task and domain levels) and generalize well in a sequential prediction setting, where the underlying data generating process varies over time. Experimental results on three real-world datasets demonstrate that DAC-ML can outperform baselines in urban dynamics prediction, especially when obvious urban dynamics and temporal uncertainties are present.","2374-8486","978-1-6654-2398-4","10.1109/ICDM51629.2021.00102","University Transportation Centers; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9679088","Spatial-temporal data mining;meta-learning;domain adaptation","Uncertainty;Roads;Conferences;Urban areas;Planning;Bayes methods;Data mining","data mining;learning (artificial intelligence);road traffic;traffic engineering computing","DAC-ML;domain adaptable continuous meta-learning;urban area;short-term urban traffic status;urban traffic management;urban traffic systems;urban dynamics prediction problem;Bayesian meta-learning perspective;spatial-temporal urban dynamics data;obvious urban dynamics","","","","46","IEEE","24 Jan 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This paper proposed a forest fire detection method based on MODIS active fire products, by adding Normalized vegetation index (NDVI), slope, elevation, and other factors as identification conditions. To verify the reliability of the proposed method, this paper used the MODIS active fire products data in China in July 2018, the identification accuracy was up to 88.94%, and the missing detection rates were only 4.25%, the error was mainly due to the low spatial resolution of MODIS data. The validation results showed that the overall accuracy of the proposed method was very satisfactory, which can meet the real-time early warning of a forest fire. Moreover, taking a forest fire that occurred in Qinyuan County, Shanxi Province as an example, the paper analyzed how to use the identified forest fire points to monitor the fire and make fire-fighting plans, which proved that using the fire points data can provide scientific bases for forest fire monitoring and extinguishing.","2161-0258","978-1-6654-2074-7","10.1109/IEEECONF54055.2021.9687646","NASA; USGS; JAXA; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9687646","Forest fire;Remote Sensing;MODIS active fire;Normalized vegetation index (NDVI)","Satellites;Vegetation mapping;Forestry;Real-time systems;Sensors;Safety;Indexes","disasters;ecology;fires;forestry;remote sensing;vegetation","MODIS active fire products data;identified forest fire points;fire-fighting plans;fire points data;forest fire monitoring;extinguishing;forest fire points detection method;MODIS active fire product;traditional monitoring method;forest fire detection method","","1","","13","IEEE","31 Jan 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

User knowledge can be formulated as inter-variable relationships to assist an optimization algorithm in finding good solutions faster. Such inter-variable interactions can also be automatically learned from high-performing solutions discovered at intermediate iterations in an optimization run – a process called innovization. These relations, if vetted by the users, can be enforced among newly generated solutions to steer the optimization algorithm towards practically promising regions in the search space. Challenges arise for large-scale problems where the number of such variable relationships may be high. This paper proposes an interactive knowledge-based evolutionary multi-objective optimization () framework that extracts hidden variable-wise relationships as knowledge from evolving high-performing solutions, shares them with users to receive feedback, and applies them back to the optimization process to improve its effectiveness. The knowledge extraction process uses a systematic and elegant graph analysis method which scales well with number of variables. The working of the proposed is demonstrated on three large-scale real-world engineering design problems. The simplicity and elegance of the proposed knowledge extraction process and achievement of high-performing solutions quickly indicate the power of the proposed framework.

In this paper, we present a two-stage ALPR framework to achieve efficient LP detection and recognition in unconstrained scenarios. Our LP detector is based on improved Yolov3-tiny, and we also propose a lightweight recognition network MRNet based on multi-scale features. In order to improve the inference speed, we abandoned the rectification of LP images, and RNNs that are difficult to compute in parallel. Additionally, we also propose a license plate data augmentation method, which achieves more effective augmentation and improves the generalization ability of the network through secondary random and hyperparametric search. As an additional contribution, we provide a challenging dataset collected from real-world driving recorders. The dataset is for multiple LPs in a single image, which makes up for the lack of public datasets in multiple LP scenarios. We evaluated the results on five datasets and showed that we achieved the best performance on almost all test sets, achieving 99.8% accuracy on CCPD with more than 180,000 license plate test sets. In terms of speed, the inference speed for detecting license plates reaches 751 FPS, and the fastest inference time for recognizing a single license plate takes only 2.9 ms.","1558-0016","","10.1109/TITS.2023.3237581","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61972097,U21A20472); National Key Research and Development Plan of China(grant numbers:2021YFB3600503); Natural Science Foundation of Fujian Province(grant numbers:2021J01612,2020J01494); Major Science and Technology Project of Fujian Province(grant numbers:2021HZ022007); Industry-Academy Cooperation Project of Fujian Province(grant numbers:2018H6010); Fujian Collaborative Innovation Center for Big Data Application in Governments; Fujian Engineering Research Center of Big Data Analysis and Processing; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10024427","Automatic license plate recognition;multi-scale fusion;lightweight model;data augmentation","License plate recognition;Image recognition;Feature extraction;Object detection;Licenses;Character recognition;Task analysis","data augmentation;deep learning (artificial intelligence);image recognition;object detection;traffic engineering computing","deep learning;detection speed;generalization ability;hyperparametric search;inference speed;license plate data augmentation;license plate detection;license plate test sets;lightweight recognition network;LP detection;LP images;MRNet;multiscale features;real-world driving recorders;recognition speed;traffic scenarios;two-stage ALPR framework;ultra-fast automatic license plate recognition;unconstrained scenarios;Yolov3-tiny","","1","","52","IEEE","23 Jan 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, standard Predictive Maintenance approaches assume the availability of sensor measurements, and the costs associated with adding sensors or remotely accessing sensor readings may discourage the development of such technologies. In this context, Alarm Forecasting can be very useful as it represents a low-cost alternative or helpful support to sensor-based Predictive Maintenance. In this work, we propose a new formulation for the Alarm Forecasting problem, framed as a multi-label classification task. We present a novel deep learning-based approach called FORMULA (alarm FORecasting in MUlti-LAbel setting). FORMULA leverages Transformer, a popular Neural Network architecture in the field of Natural Language Processing. To cope with alarm imbalance, we draw inspiration from Segmentation and Object Detection. Thus, FORMULA is trained by minimizing the Weighted Focal Loss, which turns out to be very effective in predicting rare alarms. These alarms, even if they are difficult to predict by nature, often are business-critical. We assess the proposed approach on a representative real-world problem from the packaging industry. In particular, we show that it outperforms not only classic multilabel techniques but also models based on recurrent neural networks. As regards the latter, the proposed approach also exhibits a lower computational burden, both in terms of training time and model size. To foster research in the field and reproducibility, we also publicly share the alarm logs dataset and the code used to perform the experiments. Note to Practitioners—This paper was motivated by the problem of monitoring equipment in the scenario of dairy products packaging, under the mild assumption that logs of the alarm generated by the packaging machines are available. This paper proposes an alarm forecasting algorithm. Its goal is to predict if any alarm will occur in the future, based only on past alarm logs. The limits of the considered future window can be defined arbitrarily, so there is enough time to perform corrective actions. Thus, the proposed approach aims to prevent unexpected downtime that would not only hinder productivity but also imply significant material waste. The proposed approach leverages methodologies from Natural Language Processing and Object Detection to deal with rare alarms that are often very informative in the industrial scenario. Besides, both the code and the real-world industrial datasets used to evaluate the methodology are available publicly. Currently, the proposed approach only uses alarm logs. Especially in the context of Industry 4.0, where many sensory data may be available, this is a limitation. Thus, the described approach might be extended by integrating alarm logs with sensory data. This integration is expected to improve the estimation of equipment health state. The results described in this paper may find application not only in the manufacturing sector but also in different areas such as Cyber Security, where log files keep activity records of each process performed.","1558-3783","","10.1109/TASE.2021.3127995","Regione Veneto Project VIrtualization and Remotization for Resilient and Efficient Manufacturing, Virtualizzazione e remotizzazione per una manifattura efficiente e resiliente (VIR2EM); Italian Minister for Education (MIUR) through the initiative “Departments of Excellence” (Law 232/2016); Statwolf Data Science; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9627935","Alarm forecasting;deep learning;imbalanced classification;industrial IoT;Industry 40;multi-label classification;predictive maintenance","Forecasting;Predictive models;Codes;Monitoring;Deep learning;Task analysis;Predictive maintenance","condition monitoring;data mining;learning (artificial intelligence);maintenance engineering;natural language processing;neural nets;object detection;pattern classification;production engineering computing;recurrent neural nets","rare alarms predictions;Predictive Maintenance technologies;Industrial Equipment producers;customized maintenance plans;standard Predictive Maintenance approaches;sensor measurements;adding sensors;sensor readings;Alarm Forecasting problem;multilabel classification task;deep learning-based approach;MUltiLAbel setting;FORMULA leverages Transformer;popular Neural Network architecture;Natural Language Processing;alarm imbalance;packaging industry;alarm logs;alarm forecasting algorithm;approach leverages methodologies;real-world industrial datasets","","1","","45","IEEE","29 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The aspiration point is formed by objective values which the DM wants to achieve, while the reservation point is constituted by values for the objectives not to be worsened. Internally, the first generations are performed in order to generate an initial approximation set according to the reservation point. Next, in the remaining generations, the algorithm adapts the search for new non-dominated solutions depending on the dominance relation between the solutions obtained so far and both the reservation and aspiration points. This allows knowing if the given points are achievable or not; this type of information cannot be known before the solution process starts. On this basis, the algorithm proceeds according to three different scenarios with the aim of re-orienting the search directions towards the ROI formed by the Pareto optimal solutions with objective values within the given aspiration and reservation values.

Background noise degrades image quality, despite extensive research aimed at finding a solution to this problem and the anticipation of a plethora of possible countermeasures. Methods for picture filtering, including those based on machine learning and those based on optimization, are detailed here. It has been possible to categorize these methods by the methods they employ. Gaussian noise, white noise, salt and pepper noise, speckle noise, and poison noise were all removed from lung CT scans using a combination of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and Transductive Support Vector Machines (TSVMs) in this study. Using TSVM, RNN can function better than ever before. The approach proposed here uses LSTM to normalize batches of data. By simulating a large number of individual beehives, the ABC (Artificial Bee Colony) algorithm may determine the optimal size of each batch. MATLAB was used to realize the suggested method. The experimental consequences demonstrate that the suggested system overtakes the baseline in terms of PSNR, MSE, and precision.","","979-8-3503-4595-7","10.1109/IHCSP56702.2023.10127184","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10127184","TSVM;RNN;ABC;CT scan","Support vector machines;Technological innovation;Recurrent neural networks;Toxicology;Filtering;X-rays;Speckle","computerised tomography;Gaussian noise;image denoising;image filtering;image processing;learning (artificial intelligence);lung;mean square error methods;medical image processing;neural nets;recurrent neural nets;support vector machines;white noise","consequential tasks;crucial criterion;digital form;fundamental tasks;gaussian noise;hybrid Recurrent Neural Networks;image processing;machine learning;medical image;noise degrades image quality;pepper noise;picture filtering;poison noise;possible countermeasures;pressing dilemma;speckle noise;surveillance;Transductive Support Vector Machines;TSVM","","","","15","IEEE","25 May 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The complete presentation was not made available for publication as part of the conference proceedings. Cyberinfrastructure is everywhere in diverse forms in service of applications in science, business and society. From IoT to extreme-scale computing data and computing have never been so distributed with the potential for real-time integration into these applications. The common theme to these applications, mostly composed of (big) data-integrated workloads, is their need to run in specialized environments for reasons such as on-demand or 24x7 nature of the tasks they are performing, and difficulties regarding their portability, latency, privacy, and performance optimization. Moreover, in many data-driven scientific applications, there is a need for heterogeneous integration of tasks requiring specialized computing capabilities with traditional high-throughput computing or high-performance computing tasks. Although some key middleware technologies enabled demonstration of standalone heterogeneous applications, such integration requires expertise convergence from a large group of people in very specialized settings.

Deep learning has recently emerged as effective methods for machine FDD applications. However, the gradient descent optimization method that is commonly used in deep learning suffers from several limitations, such as high computational cost and local sub-optimal solutions. Accordingly, this paper proposes a new parallel ensemble model comprising hybrid machine and deep learning for undertaking FDD tasks. Composed of three levels of learning, the proposed ensemble model employs two base learners and a meta-learner, and is executed in parallel processing platform to achieve efficient computation. The base learners adopt a hybrid Back-Propagation (BP) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithms to exploit the corresponding local and global optimization capabilities for identifying optimal features and improving FDD performance. The proposed model is validated through a series of experiments using two benchmark data sets, i.e., CWRU and MAFaulD. The results demonstrate a high performance with accuracy rates of 98.45% and 99.79% for CWRU and MAFaulD, respectively. Its parallel implementation is able to reduce the computation time, resulting in a speed-up of 5.9 time and 7.17 time, respectively. These findings indicate that the proposed model is effective and efficient for FDD of industrial machinery, making it a promising solution for implementation in real-world environments.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3267089","Fundamental Research Grant Scheme (FRGS) from the Malaysia Ministry of Higher Education; Multimedia University (MMU) Grant; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10102468","Fault detection and diagnosis;deep learning;machine learning;ensemble learning;parallel computing;hybrid optimization","Feature extraction;Machinery;Hidden Markov models;Computational modeling;Task analysis;Mathematical models;Ensemble learning","backpropagation;deep learning (artificial intelligence);fault diagnosis;machinery;mechanical engineering computing;parallel processing;particle swarm optimisation","back-propagation;base learners;BP;deep learning;fault detection and diagnosis;FDD;industrial machinery;meta-learner;parallel ensemble learning;parallel processing platform;particle swarm optimization;PSO","","","","47","CCBYNCND","14 Apr 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Due to the sheer number of involved participants, it is crucial to protect the dataflow integrity in the pipeline. While previous studies have outlined solutions to this matter, the solution for an untrusted data pipeline is still left unexplored, which motivates us to propose SIGNORA. Our proposal combines the concept of a chain of signatures with blockchain receipt to provide dataflow integrity. The chain of signatures provides a non-repudiation guarantee from participants, while the hash of the data and signatures is anchored in the blockchain for a non-tampering guarantee through blockchain receipt. Aside from that, SIGNORA also satisfies essential requirements of running data pipeline processing in an open and untrusted environment, such as (i) providing reliable identity management, (ii) solving the trust and accountability issues through a reputation system, (iii) supporting various devices through multiple cryptographic algorithms (i.e., ECDSA, EdDSA, RSA, and HMAC), and (iv) off-chain processing. Our experiment results show that SIGNORA can provide dataflow integrity provisioning in multiple scenarios of data payload size with reasonable overhead. Furthermore, the cost of smart contract methods has also been analyzed, and several off-chain solutions have been addressed to reduce transaction costs. Finally, the reputation system can adapt to the history of nodes’ activities by increasing their scores when they actively perform honest behavior while reducing their scores when they become inactive. Therefore, SIGNORA can provide a high degree of accountability for participants collaborating in an untrusted environment.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3199878","Institute for Information and Communications Technology Planning and Evaluation (IITP) Grant through the Korea Government [Ministry of Science and ICT (MSIT)], Convergence security core talent training business (Pusan National University)(grant numbers:2022-0-01201); Human Resources Development Program of the Korea Institute of Energy Technology Evaluation and Planning (KETEP) Grant through the Korea Government Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy(grant numbers:20184030202060); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9861623","Dataflow integrity;blockchain;chain of signatures;blockchain receipt;data pipeline","Blockchains;Data processing;Cloud computing;Pipeline processing;Receivers;Behavioral sciences;Smart contracts;Data flow computing","blockchains;digital signatures;pipeline processing;public key cryptography","SIGNORA;blockchain-based framework;dataflow integrity provisioning;untrusted data pipeline;processed data;blockchain receipt;nonrepudiation guarantee;data pipeline processing;open environment;untrusted environment;off-chain processing;data payload size;off-chain solutions;reputation system;cryptographic algorithms","","","","33","CCBY","18 Aug 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Because of the high-dimensional datasets and the rapid growth of data volume, a lot of challenges have been encountered in various fields such as data mining and data science. Conventional machine learning classifiers are of limited ability to handle the problems of high dimensionality that includes memory limitation, computational cost, and low accuracy performance. Consequently, there is a need to reduce the dimension of datasets by choosing the most significant features that would represent the data efficiently with minimum volume. This study proposes an improved binary version of the equilibrium optimizer algorithm (IBEO) to mitigate features selection problem. Two main enhancements are added to the original equilibrium optimizer (EO) to strengthen its performance. Opposition based learning is the first advancement added to the initialization stage of EO to enhance the diversity of the population in the search space. Local search algorithm is the second advancement added to enhance the exploitation of EO. Wrapper approaches can offer premium solutions. Thus, we used k-nearest neighbour classifier and support vector machine classifiers as the most popular wrapper methods. Moreover, dealing with the problem of over-fitting is an essential task that urges on applying k-fold cross-validation to split each dataset into training and testing data. Comparative tests with different well-known algorithms such as grey wolf optimization, grasshopper optimization, particle swarm optimization, whale optimization, dragonfly, and improved salp swarm algorithms are considered. The proposed algorithm is applied to the most commonly datasets used in the field to validate the performance. Statistical analysis studies demonstrate the effectiveness of the IBEO.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3108097","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9523539","Equilibrium optimizer (EO);feature selection;optimization;machine learning (ML);opposition based learning (OBL);classification","Feature extraction;Genetic algorithms;Convergence;Support vector machines;Transfer functions;Search problems;Particle swarm optimization","data mining;feature extraction;feature selection;learning (artificial intelligence);particle swarm optimisation;pattern classification;search problems;statistical analysis;support vector machines","high-dimensional datasets;data volume;data mining;memory limitation;computational cost;low accuracy performance;minimum volume;improved binary version;IBEO;features selection problem;EO;initialization stage;search space;local search algorithm;wrapper approaches;neighbour classifier;support vector machine classifiers;k-fold cross-validation;testing data;grey wolf optimization;grasshopper optimization;particle swarm optimization;whale optimization;salp swarm algorithms;commonly datasets;statistical analysis studies;improved equilibrium optimizer algorithm;digital devices;data representation","","12","","88","CCBY","26 Aug 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In particular, Knowledge Graph Embedding (KGE) methods have gained increasing attention due to their effectiveness in representing real-world structured information while preserving relevant properties. Current research mainly focuses on improving and comparing the effectiveness of new KGE models on different predictive tasks. However, the application of KGE techniques in the industrial scenario sets a series of requirements on the runtime performance of the employed models. For this reason, this work aims to enable an effortless characterization of the runtime performance of KGE methods in terms of memory footprint and execution time. To this extent, we propose KGE-Perf, a framework for evaluating available state-of-the-art implementations of KGE models against graphs with different properties, focusing on the efficacy of the adopted optimization strategies. Experimental evaluation of three representative KGE algorithms on open-access KGs shows that multi-threading on CPU is effective, but its benefits decrease as the number of threads grows. The usage of vectorized instruction shows encouraging results in speeding up the training of KGE models, but GPU proves, hands down, to be the best architecture for the given task. Moreover, experimental results show how the RAM usage strongly depends on the input KG, with only slight variations between different models or hardware configurations.","2687-6817","978-1-6654-4135-3","10.1109/RTSI50628.2021.9597228","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9597228","Knowledge Graphs;Knowledge Graph Embedding;Performance;Multi-Threading;Vectorization;GPU","Training;Industries;Runtime;Instruction sets;Random access memory;Predictive models;Natural language processing","data mining;graph theory;learning (artificial intelligence);mathematics computing;multi-threading;natural language processing;optimisation;query processing;recommender systems","runtime performance;Knowledge Graph Embedding methods;Knowledge Graphs;powering recommendation systems;natural language processing;query answering;representation learning;unprecedentedly effective graph mining;real-world structured information;relevant properties;KGE models;different predictive tasks;KGE techniques;employed models;KGE methods;KGE-Perf;representative KGE algorithms;open-access KGs;hardware configurations","","","","20","IEEE","15 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Moreover, IoT applications are emerging in diverse verticals such as connected cars, connected factories, and smart agriculture. For new business models, in order to meet key network performance indicators, connectivity must be flexible and agile. An integrated satellite-aerial-terrestrial network (I-SAT) has recently stimulated interest in providing wireless communication due to its high maneuverability, versatile deployment, and pervasive connectivity. The resource planning, task distribution, and action management of an I-SAT can be accomplished through effective acquisition, coordination, transmission, and aggregation of diverse information. This paper considers an I-SAT network, in which multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) with aerial stations and a terrestrial base station (BS), in a cognitive setting, in the presence of satellite-receiver communication, are deployed to support smart vehicles on the ground. By taking into account different limitations and Quality of Service (QoS) constraints, the goal is to maximize the average throughput among users by jointly optimizing user association, BS/UAV transmission power, and UAV trajectory. The formulated problem is a non-convex optimization problem with a complicated expression that is hard to solve. To tackle this problem, an alternating iterative algorithm based on the block descent method is proposed. Precisely, the problem is subdivided into three subproblems, transmitter-vehicle association optimization, BS/UAV power allocation optimization, and UAV trajectory control. Then, in an iterative process, these subproblems are solved sequentially. The proposed solution uses a segment-by-segment technique, which breaks the complete UAV flight trajectory into smaller time segments to reduce computation time when the network service period is considerable. As a result, each time segment’s optimization can be solved more quickly. Furthermore, the paper presents the results of network simulations carried out to assess the efficiency of the proposed solution. The findings show that the presented scheme outperforms different benchmark schemes in terms of the average user throughput when observing multiple different scenarios.","1558-2248","","10.1109/TWC.2021.3120264","Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)(grant numbers:RGPIN-2020-04678); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9583851","Integrated networks;unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs);satellite communications;cognitive radio (CR);throughput maximization;user association;power optimization;trajectory control","Trajectory;Internet of Things;Satellites;Throughput;Satellite broadcasting;Resource management;Optimization","aircraft communication;artificial satellites;autonomous aerial vehicles;cellular radio;concave programming;control engineering computing;convex programming;Internet of Things;iterative methods;quality of service;radio links;remotely operated vehicles;resource allocation;trajectory control","joint user association;power optimization;integrated satellite-aerial-terrestrial network;connected devices;IoT applications;connected cars;connected factories;network performance indicators;pervasive connectivity;I-SAT network;multiple unmanned aerial vehicles;aerial stations;terrestrial base station;satellite-receiver communication;smart vehicles;nonconvex optimization problem;transmitter-vehicle association optimization;UAV trajectory control;complete UAV flight trajectory;network service period;time segment;network simulations","","8","","36","IEEE","21 Oct 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Having in mind that even a small change in customer churn can have a significant impact on a company's profits and overall value of the company, proper customer churn management is a prerequisite. When it comes to banks, the key issue is identifying reasons (factors) that lead to contract termination between a customer and a bank. This paper offers a new model for forecasting customer churn and determines the contribution of variables that could lead to losing a customer. This work presents a novel artificial intelligence approach for predicting churn using the XGboost methods. A novel metaheuristic algorithm is proposed and tasked with se-lecting optimal hyperparameters for the XGBoost algorithm. The performance of the algorithm has been evaluated on real-world data and compared to several cutting-edge algorithms, attaining the best performance, with the highest accuracy of approximately 97%, which proves presumption that customer credit card churn could be forecast with high precision. Additionally, the best models have been subjected to SHAP analysis to determine feature impact. Attained results show that features that belong to customer account information have the strongest impact on customer turnover, while personal customer information does not have or has little contribution. Features with the highest SHAP values are total transaction count and amount over the last 12 months and total revolving card balance.","","978-1-6654-6487-1","10.1109/ICSMDI57622.2023.00018","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10127871","Credit Card Churn Prediction;Sine Cosine Algorithm;XGBoost;Metaheuristics;Optimization;Shapley Additive Explanations","Metaheuristics;Companies;Pressing;Predictive models;Prediction algorithms;Credit cards;Approximation algorithms","bank data processing;credit transactions;data mining;decision trees;financial data processing;metaheuristics;random forests;regression analysis","customer account information;customer credit card churn;customer turnover;cutting-edge algorithms;metaheuristic algorithm;modified sine cosine algorithm;optimal hyperparameters;personal customer information;predicting credit card churn;proper customer churn management;retaining customers;subscription-based financial institutions;XGBoost algorithm;XGboost methods;XGBoost tuned","","","","36","IEEE","26 May 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Existing truth discovery methods attempt to infer the true attribute values for the entities by identifying and trusting reliable data sources. That is, the values provided by reliable sources are more likely to be the true values. However, all these methods neglect the relations among different entities, which play important roles in truth discovery task. When reliable data sources cannot provide sufficient information of entities, the true attribute values of these entities can still be inferred by propagating trustworthy information from related entities. Motivated by this, in this paper, we introduce the constrained truth discovery problem. We incorporate denial constraints, a universally quantified first-order logic formalism which can express a large number of effective and widely existing relations among entities, into the process of truth discovery. We formulate it as a constrained optimization problem and analyze its hardness. To address the problem, we propose algorithms to partition the entities into disjoint groups, and generate arithmetic constraints for each disjoint group separately. Then, the true attribute values of the entities in each disjoint group are derived by minimizing the objective function under the corresponding arithmetic constraints. Experimental results on both real-world and synthetic datasets demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves good performance even with very few constraints and reliable sources.","1558-2191","","10.1109/TKDE.2020.2982393","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:U1866602,61602129,61772157); CCF-Huawei Database System Innovation Research Plan(grant numbers:DBIR2019005B); Microsoft Research Asia; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9044433","Truth discovery;denial constraints;arithmetic constraints;source weights;iterative process","Reliability;Urban areas;Remuneration;Optimization;Task analysis;Partitioning algorithms;Correlation","data mining;formal logic;graph theory;optimisation","disjoint group;attribute values;reliable sources;diversified sources;hotspot research topic;truth discovery methods attempt;reliable data sources;truth discovery task;sufficient information;trustworthy information;related entities;constrained truth discovery problem;constrained optimization problem","","7","","36","IEEE","23 Mar 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Most existing traffic speed prediction models are proposed based on the hypothesis that traffic data are complete or have rare missing values. However, such data collected in real-world scenarios are often incomplete due to various human and natural factors. Although this problem can be solved by first estimating the missing values with an imputation model and then applying a prediction model, the former potentially breaks critical latent features and further leads to the error accumulation issues. To tackle this problem, we propose a graph-based spatio-temporal autoencoder that follows an encoder-decoder structure for spatio-temporal traffic speed prediction with missing values. Specifically, we regard the imputation and prediction as two parallel tasks and train them sequentially to eliminate the negative impact of imputation on raw data for prediction and accelerate the model training process. Furthermore, we utilize graph convolutional layers with a self-adaptive adjacency matrix for spatial dependencies modeling and apply gated recurrent units for temporal learning. To evaluate the proposed model, we conduct comprehensive case studies on two real-world traffic datasets with two different missing patterns and a wide and practical missing rate range from 20% to 80%. Experimental results demonstrate that the model consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art traffic prediction with missing values methods and achieves steady performance in the investigated missing scenarios and prediction horizons.","1558-0016","","10.1109/TITS.2022.3233890","Stable Support Plan Program of Shenzhen Natural Science Fund(grant numbers:20200925155105002); General Program of Guangdong Basic and Applied Basic Research Foundation(grant numbers:2019A1515011032); Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory(grant numbers:2020B121201001); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10012030","Traffic speed prediction;missing data;spatio-temporal modeling;deep learning;multi-task learning","Task analysis;Predictive models;Training;Multitasking;Feature extraction;Deep learning;Data mining","convolutional neural nets;graph theory;intelligent transportation systems;learning (artificial intelligence);recurrent neural nets;road traffic;spatiotemporal phenomena;traffic engineering computing","critical latent features;different missing patterns;error accumulation issues;existing traffic speed prediction models;graph-based spatio-temporal autoencoder;imputation model;intelligent transportation systems;investigated missing scenarios;missing data;model training process;multitask learning approach;parallel tasks;practical missing rate range;prediction horizons;prediction model;rare missing values;raw data;real-world traffic data;real-world traffic datasets;spatio-temporal traffic speed prediction;state-of-the-art traffic prediction;temporal learning;values methods;wide rate range","","","","52","IEEE","9 Jan 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The popularity of these methods also makes them widely exposed to malicious attacks, which may cause severe security concerns. To understand the security properties of the ML/DL methods, researchers have recently started to turn their focus to adversarial attack algorithms that could successfully corrupt the model or clean data owned by the victim with imperceptible perturbations. In this paper, we study the Label Flipping Attack (LFA) problem, where the attacker expects to corrupt an ML/DL model's performance by flipping a small fraction of the labels in the training data. Prior art along this direction adopts combinatorial optimization problems, leading to limited scalability toward deep learning models. To this end, we propose a novel minimax problem which provides an efficient reformulation of the sample selection process in LFA. In the new optimization problem, the sample selection operation could be implemented with a single thresholding parameter. This leads to a novel training algorithm called Sample Thresholding. Since the objective function is differentiable and the model complexity does not depend on the sample size, we can apply Sample Thresholding to attack deep learning models. Moreover, since the victim's behavior is not predictable in a poisonous attack setting, we have to employ surrogate models to simulate the true model employed by the victim model. Seeing the problem, we provide a theoretical analysis of such a surrogate paradigm. Specifically, we show that the performance gap between the true model employed by the victim and the surrogate model is small under mild conditions. On top of this paradigm, we extend Sample Thresholding to the crowdsourced ranking task, where labels collected from the annotators are vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Finally, experimental analyses on three real-world datasets speak to the efficacy of our method.","1939-3539","","10.1109/TPAMI.2022.3220849","National Key R & D Program of China(grant numbers:2018AAA0102000); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:U21B2038,61931008,62025604,U1936208,6212200758,61976202); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities; Youth Innovation Promotion Association of the Chinese Academy of Sciences; Strategic Priority Research Program of Chinese Academy of Sciences(grant numbers:XDB28000000); China National Postdoctoral Program for Innovative Talents(grant numbers:BX2021298); China Postdoctoral Science Foundation(grant numbers:2022M713101); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9944159","Label flipping attack;machine learning","Data models;Training data;Training;Deep learning;Predictive models;Testing;Optimization","computer network security;crowdsourcing;deep learning (artificial intelligence);learning (artificial intelligence);minimax techniques;optimisation","adversarial attack algorithms;adversarial attacks;AI applications;clean data;combinatorial optimization problems;deep learning models;fundamental building blocks;Label Flipping Attack problem;LFA;malicious attacks;model complexity;novel minimax problem;optimization problem;poisonous attack setting;sample masking;sample selection operation;sample selection process;security properties;severe security concerns;single thresholding parameter;surrogate model;training algorithm calledSample Thresholding;training data;victim model","","","","59","IEEE","9 Nov 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Compared with the large-scale coverage areas for remote sensing imagery, the key objects, such as cars and ships, in HRS imagery often contain only a few pixels. In this article, to tackle this problem, the foreground activation (FA)-driven small object semantic segmentation (FactSeg) framework is proposed from perspectives of structure and optimization. In the structure design, FA object representation is proposed to enhance the awareness of the weak features in small objects. The FA object representation framework is made up of a dual-branch decoder and collaborative probability (CP) loss. In the dual-branch decoder, the FA branch is designed to activate the small object features (activation) and suppress the large-scale background, and the semantic refinement (SR) branch is designed to further distinguish small objects (refinement). The CP loss is proposed to effectively combine the activation and refinement outputs of the decoder under the CP hypothesis. During the collaboration, the weak features of the small objects are enhanced with the activation output, and the refined output can be viewed as the refinement of the binary outputs. In the optimization stage, small object mining (SOM)-based network optimization is applied to automatically select effective samples and refine the direction of the optimization while addressing the imbalanced sample problem between the small objects and the large-scale background. The experimental results obtained with two benchmark HRS imagery segmentation datasets demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms the state-of-the-art semantic segmentation methods and achieves a good tradeoff between accuracy and efficiency.

Due to a limited amount of resources at the EC compared to the back-end cloud (BC), intelligent resource management techniques become imperative. This paper studies the problem of multi-resource allocation (MRA) in terms of compute and wireless resources in an integrated EC and BC environment. Machine learning-based approaches are emerging to solve such optimization problems. However, it is challenging to adopt traditional discrete action space-based methods due to their high dimensionality issue. To this end, we propose a deep-deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) based temporal feature learning attentional network (TFLAN) model to address the MRA problem. TFLAN combines convolution, gated recurrent unit and attention layers together to mine local and long term temporal information from the task sequences for excellent function approximation. A novel heuristic-based priority experience replay (hPER) method is formulated to accelerate the convergence speed. Further, a pruning principle helps the TFLAN agent to significantly reduce the computational complexity and balance the load among base stations and servers to minimize the rejection-rate. Lastly, data parallelism technique is adopted for distributed training to meet the needs of a high-volume of IoT traffic in the EC environment. Experimental results demonstrate that the distributed training approach suites well to the problem scale and can magnify the speed of the learning process. We validate the proposed framework by comparing with five state-of-the-art RL agents. Our proposed agent converges fast and achieves up to 28% and 72% reduction in operational cost and rejection-rate, and achieves up to 32% gain in the quality of experience on average, compared to the most advanced DDPG agent.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3249153","NSF PAWR COSMOS(grant numbers:1827923); NSF IRNC COSMIC(grant numbers:2029295); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10054044","Edge cloud computing;wireless networks;deep deterministic policy gradient;resource allocation;smart city;IoT;beyond 5G;distributed training;heuristic priority experience replay","Resource management;Internet of Things;Edge computing;Costs;Computational modeling;5G mobile communication;Cloud computing;Heuristic algorithms;Wireless networks","5G mobile communication;cloud computing;computational complexity;computer network security;deep learning (artificial intelligence);function approximation;gradient methods;Internet of Things;optimisation;recurrent neural nets;resource allocation;telecommunication computing","B5G;back-end cloud;base stations;BC environment;beyond 5G wireless networks;computational complexity;data parallelism technique;DDPG;deep-deterministic policy gradient;discrete action space-based methods;distributed training approach suites;edge-cloud system;function approximation;gated recurrent unit;heuristic-based priority experience replay method;hPER;integrated EC environment;intelligent resource management techniques;Internet-of-Things;IoT traffic;local term temporal information;machine learning-based approaches;MRA problem;multiresource allocation;optimization problems;real-time traffics;temporal feature learning attentional network model;TFLAN agent;wireless resources","","","","59","CCBY","27 Feb 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Various consensus model subsets may benefit from the various blockchain mining techniques proposed by researchers. Most of these techniques, however, are rather complicated, which slows down the mining process for large-scale blockchains. Overly simplistic models that include unnecessary redundancies are inefficient and have little practical use. To solve these issues and boost blockchain mining efficiency in large-scale deployments, the authors of this paper propose creating a novel hybrid bioinspired approach. The proposed IP Network model is adaptable to almost all consensus procedures and may be easily combined with dynamic consensus models with few alterations. After collecting performance and context-specific data from the underlying blockchains, the technique uses Genetic Algorithm (GA) that distributes these range sets among miner nodes that support trust, allowing for high-performance mining while maintaining a high degree of trust under actual application situations. The model was tested against Proof-of-Stake (PoS), Proof-of- Work (PoW), Proof-of- Trust (PoT), and Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT) based consensus algorithms to ensure its effectiveness in real-world scenarios. Mining latency, energy consumption, and computational complexity were used as metrics against which this performance was measured. This analysis revealed that the proposed model has the potential to decrease mining latency by 4.5%, energy usage by 3.9%, and compute complexity by 4.1% across a variety of consensus mechanisms, making it suitable for a number of real-time applications.","","978-1-6654-6487-1","10.1109/ICSMDI57622.2023.00045","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10127936","IP;Networks;Blockchain;Mining;GA;Delay;Energy;Complexity;Consensus","Adaptation models;Biological system modeling;Computational modeling;Redundancy;Real-time systems;Performance analysis;IP networks","blockchains;computational complexity;computer network fault tolerance;computer network management;computer network security;data mining;energy conservation;genetic algorithms;IP networks","bioinspired-blockchain technique;blockchain mining techniques;chain management;computational complexity;compute complexity;consensus procedures;context-specific data;dynamic consensus models;energy consumption;genetic algorithm;hash generation;high-performance mining;hybrid bioinspired approach;IP network model;large-scale blockchains;large-scale deployments;mining latency;mining process;network management system;performance analysis;practical byzantine fault tolerance based consensus algorithm;proof-of-stake algorithm;proof-of-trust algorithm;proof-of-work algorithm;rule optimization;rule verification;unnecessary redundancies","","","","30","IEEE","26 May 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Recently, several unsupervised methods focusing on user representations pre-training have been explored. In general, these methods apply similar learning paradigms by first corrupting the behavior sequence, and then restoring the original input with some item-level prediction loss functions. Despite its effectiveness, we argue that there exist important gaps between such item-level optimization objective and user-level representations, and as a result, the learned user representations may only lead to sub-optimal generalization performance. In this paper, we propose a novel self-supervised pre-training framework, called CLUE, which stands for employing Contrastive Learning for modeling sequence-level User rEpresentation. The core idea of CLUE is to regard each user behavior sequence as a whole and then construct the self-supervision signals by transforming the original user behaviors by data augmentations (DA). Specifically, we employ two Siamese (weight-sharing) networks to learn the user-oriented representations, where the optimization goal is to maximize the similarity of learned representations of the same user by these two encoders. More importantly, we perform careful investigation of the impacts of view generating strategies for user behavior inputs from a more comprehensive perspective, including processing sequential behaviors by explicit DA strategies and employing dropout as implicit DA. To verify the effectiveness of CLUE, we perform extensive experiments on several user-related tasks with different scales and characteristics. Our experimental results show that the user representations learned by CLUE surpass existing item-level baselines under several evaluation protocols.","2374-8486","978-1-6654-2398-4","10.1109/ICDM51629.2021.00015","National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9679158","Recommender systems;User representation;Contrastive learning;Sequential behaviors","Protocols;Conferences;Focusing;Data mining;Task analysis;Optimization;Recommender systems","neural nets;optimisation;recommender systems;supervised learning","weight-sharing networks;Siamese networks;data augmentations;self-supervision signals;transferable user representations;item-level optimization;self-supervised pre-training framework;sequence-level user representation;sub-optimal generalization performance;user-level representations;item-level prediction loss functions;user representations pre-training;recommender systems;sequential user-item interactions;contrastive pre-training;sequential behaviors;user-oriented representations;user behavior sequence;contrastive learning;CLUE","","4","","50","IEEE","24 Jan 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Web Services are an essential component that helps the business in this regard. But it is very complex to discover the best one from the vast web services pool. The proliferation of services that deliver similar functionalities is rising exponentially. With the advent of meta-heuristic computing, several models have been developed based living on the behavior of many living organisms. These models have been used either alone or in association with other algorithms to solve many optimization problems. Web Service selection is one such application where these models have been used. In this approach, a grey wolf algorithm is proposed to solve the problem of web service selection which has been formulated as a constraint-based selection task.

Existing approaches assume that the feature space is fixed or changes by following explicit regularities, limiting their applicability in real-time applications. For example, in a smart healthcare platform, the feature space of the patient data varies when different medical service providers use nonidentical feature sets to describe the patients’ symptoms. To fill the gap, we in this article propose a novel learning paradigm, namely, Generative Learning With Streaming Capricious (GLSC) data, which does not make any assumption on the feature space dynamics. In other words, GLSC handles the data streams with a varying feature space, where each arriving data instance can arbitrarily carry new features and/or stop carrying partial old features. Specifically, GLSC trains a learner on a universal feature space that establishes relationships between old and new features, so that the patterns learned in the old feature space can be used in the new feature space. The universal feature space is constructed by leveraging the relatednesses among features. We propose a generative graphical model to model the construction process, and show that learning from the universal feature space can effectively improve the performance with theoretical guarantees. The experimental results demonstrate that GLSC achieves conspicuous performance on both synthetic and real data sets.","2162-2388","","10.1109/TNNLS.2020.2981386","National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2016YFB1000901); National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)(grant numbers:91746209); U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF)(grant numbers:IIS-1652107,IIS-1763620,CCF-1750886); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9066871","Biconvex optimization;capricious data streams;graphical model;online learning","Medical services;Task analysis;Graphical models;Learning systems;Data mining;Prediction algorithms;Training","data mining;feature extraction;graph theory;learning (artificial intelligence)","universal feature space;data streams mining;data instance;Generative Learning With Streaming Capricious data;GLSC data;generative graphical model","","12","","48","IEEE","14 Apr 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Existing approaches either rely on a fixed pre-defined graph (e.g., a road network) or learn the correlations between locations. However, most methods suffer from spurious correlation and do not sufficiently consider the traffic's causal relationships. This study proposes a Spatiotemporal Causal Graph Inference (ST-CGI) framework for traffic prediction tasks that learn both the causal graph and autoregressive processes. We decouple the spatiotemporal traffic prediction process into two steps; the causal graph inference step and the autoregressive step, where the latter relies on the former. Optimizing the entire framework on the autoregressive task approximates the Granger causality test and thus enables excellent interpretability of the prediction. Extensive experimentation using two real-world datasets demonstrates the outstanding performance of the proposed models.","","978-1-6654-6880-0","10.1109/ITSC55140.2022.9922211","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9922211","","Visualization;Correlation;Roads;Predictive models;Spatiotemporal phenomena;Task analysis;Optimization","autoregressive processes;causality;data mining;graph theory;learning (artificial intelligence);road traffic","Granger Causal Inference;interpretable traffic prediction;modeling spatial dependency;traffic prediction tasks;spatial-temporal graph-based models;fixed pre-defined graph;spurious correlation;Spatiotemporal Causal Graph Inference framework;autoregressive processes;spatiotemporal traffic prediction process;autoregressive step;autoregressive task;Granger causality test","","","","23","IEEE","1 Nov 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this work, we demonstrate a novel system called OneBM (One Button Machine), that enables data scientists to increase their efficiency with automated feature engineering for relational data. OneBM takes as input a relational dataset with multiple tables and its entity relation diagram (ERD) which can be declared with a novel, easy-to-use drag-and-drop graphical user interface. The system then automatically identifies and executes relevant joins and aggregates in the data, and generates new features with a rich set of transformations for various types of data including but not limited to time-series, sequences, number sets and itemsets, etc. The generated features then can be used by automated model selection and hyper-parameter optimization algorithms to complete a fully end-to-end automated data science (or AutoDS) workflow. A follow-up user evaluation illustrated how data scientists can perform multi-table feature engineering tasks in minutes using our system, compared to repeatedly coding SQL-like queries to transform and aggregate relational data requiring weeks of manual labor for comparable performance.

Incentive mechanism is fundamentally important for mobile crowdsensing systems. Many mobile crowdsensing systems expect to optimize multiple objectives simultaneously. Most of the existing works transform the multiobjective problem into a single objective problem through constraints or scalarization method. However, due to the uncertain importance (weights) of objectives and the instable quality of crowdsensed data, such transformation is usually unrealizable. In this article, we aim to optimize the worst performance of two objective functions in mobile crowdsensing in order to improve the system robustness. We model an auction-based biobjective robust mobile crowdsensing system, and design two independent objective functions to maximize the expected profit and coverage, respectively. We formulate the robust user selection (RUS) problem, and design an incentive mechanism, which utilizes the combination of binary search and greedy algorithm, to solve the RUS problem.

Moreover, the proposed incentive mechanism can be easily extended to multiobjective robust mobile crowdsensing systems, and all desirable properties still hold.

However, one of the major drawbacks in the cryptocurrency market is the unreliability and unpredictability of their values, that poses a major risk for any kind of investment. Predicting the price of cryptocurrencies is therefore a hot research domain today.

In order to take best advantage of the high volume of data for accurate sentiment analysis, it is essential to clean the data before the analysis, as irrelevant or redundant data will hinder extracting valuable information. In this paper, we propose a hybrid feature selection algorithm to improve the performance of sentiment analysis tasks. Our proposed sentiment analysis approach builds a binary classification model based on two feature selection techniques: an entropy-based metric and an evolutionary algorithm. We have performed comprehensive experiments in two different domains using a benchmark dataset, Stanford Sentiment Treebank, and a real-world dataset we have created based on World Health Organization (WHO) public speeches regarding COVID-19. The proposed feature selection model is shown to achieve significant performance improvements in both datasets, increasing classification accuracy for all utilized machine learning and text representation technique combinations.

Evolutionary artificial intelligence (AI) approaches have recently been proposed to automatically determine the most effective interventions by generating a large number of candidate strategies customized for different countries and locales and evaluating them with predictive models. These epidemiological models and advanced AI techniques assist policy makers by providing them with strategies in balancing the need to contain the pandemic and the need to minimize their economic impact as well as educating the general public about ways to reduce the chance of infection. However, they do not advise an individual citizen at a specific moment and location on taking the best course of actions to accomplish a task such as grocery shopping while minimizing infection.Therefore, this paper describes a new project aiming to develop a mobile-phone-deployable, real-time COVID-19 infection risk assessment and mitigation (RT-CIRAM) system which analyzes up-to-date data from multiple open sources leveraging urgent HPC/cloud computing, coupled with time-critical scheduling and routing techniques. Implementation of a RT-CIRAM prototype is underway, and it will be made available to the public. Facing the increasing spread of the more contagious Delta (B.1.617.2) and Delta Plus (AY.4.2) variants, this personal system will be especially useful for individual citizen to reduce her/his infection risk despite increasing vaccination rates while contributing to containing the spread of the current and future pandemics.","","978-1-6654-1130-1","10.1109/UrgentHPC54802.2021.00009","University of Houston; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9651302","real-time systems;risk assessment;risk mitigation;machine learning;data mining;evolutionary surrogate-assisted prescription;COVID-19;pandemic;real-time scheduling;traffic routing;privacy","COVID-19;Pandemics;Processor scheduling;Prototypes;Predictive models;Routing;Real-time systems","artificial intelligence;cloud computing;data analysis;diseases;epidemics;health care;parallel processing;public domain software;risk management","school closures;evolutionary artificial intelligence approaches;candidate strategies;predictive models;epidemiological models;AI techniques;time-critical scheduling;routing techniques;public-domain data;COVID-19 pandemic;nonpharmaceutical interventions;social distancing;facial coverings;business;NPIs;mobile-phone-deployable;real-time COVID-19 infection risk assessment and mitigation system;RT-CIRAM;HPC;cloud computing;Delta (B.1.617.2) variants;Delta Plus (AY.4.2) variants","","1","","63","IEEE","20 Dec 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Online user-behavior modeling, as such, has been actively researched in recent years. However, due to the data uncertainty (sparse-ness and skewness), traditional techniques suffer from certain drawbacks, such as relying on labor-intensive expertise or prior knowledge, lacking of interpretability and transparency, and expensive computational cost. As a step toward bridging the gap, this paper proposes a fuzzy-set based contrastive learning algorithm. The general idea is to design an end-to-end learning framework of optimizing representation from contrastive samples. The proposed algorithm is characterized by three main modules, including data augmentation, fuzzy encoder, and semi-supervised optimization. More precisely, data augmentation is used to produce contrastive (positive and negative) samples based on anchor ones. The fuzzy encoder is introduced to fuzzify (or encode) latent representation of those contrastive samples, while the semi-supervised learning is then implemented to optimize the fuzzy encoder and minimize the training loss simultaneously. The advantage of the proposed algorithm includes no requirement of domain knowledge, preserving the transparency and interpretability of result, and computational effectiveness. Experimental results, based on a real-world app usage dataset, demonstrate that the applicability and flexibility of the proposed algorithm, compared with other state-of-the-art methods.","1558-4739","978-1-6654-4407-1","10.1109/FUZZ45933.2021.9494588","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9494588","User online behavior;Fuzzy set;Contrastive learning;Self-supervised learning;Mobile applications analysis","Training;Fuzzy sets;Uncertainty;Semisupervised learning;Natural language processing;Classification algorithms;Task analysis","data mining;fuzzy set theory;learning (artificial intelligence);mobile computing","fuzzy contrastive learning;online behavior analysis;smart devices;digital resource;online user-behavior modeling;data uncertainty;sparse-ness;skewness;labor-intensive expertise;transparency;expensive computational cost;fuzzy-set based contrastive learning algorithm;end-to-end learning framework;optimizing representation;contrastive samples;data augmentation;fuzzy encoder;semisupervised optimization;semisupervised learning","","","","15","IEEE","5 Aug 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

While seminal topic modelling techniques such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) have been proposed, the ubiquity of social media and the brevity of its texts pose unique challenges for such traditional topic modelling techniques. Several extensions including auxiliary aggregation, self aggregation and direct learning have been proposed to mitigate these challenges, however some still remain. These include a lack of consistency in the topics generated and the decline in model performance in applications involving disparate document lengths. There is a recent paradigm shift towards neural topic models, which are not suited for resource-constrained environments. This paper revisits LDA-style techniques, taking a theoretical approach to analyse the relationship between word co-occurrence and topic models. Our analysis shows that by altering the word co-occurrences within the corpus, topic discovery can be enhanced. Thus we propose a novel data transformation approach dubbed DATM to improve the topic discovery within a corpus. A rigorous empirical evaluation shows that DATM is not only powerful, but it can also be used in conjunction with existing benchmark techniques to significantly improve their effectiveness and their consistency by up to 2 fold.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3262653","Charles Sturt University publication grant; Charles Sturt University Early Career Researcher Award 2021; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10083137","Document transformation;greedy algorithm;information retrieval;latent dirichlet allocation;multi-set multi-cover problem;probabilistic generative topic modelling","Data models;Reliability;Australia;Task analysis;Social networking (online);Context modeling;Benchmark testing;Document handling","data mining;information retrieval;natural language processing;social networking (online);text analysis","auxiliary aggregation;benchmark techniques;data mining tasks;DATM;improved effectiveness;Latent Dirichlet Allocation;LDA-style techniques;neural topic models;novel data agnostic topic modeling technique;novel data transformation approach;seminal topic modelling techniques;topic discovery;traditional topic modelling techniques;word co-occurrence","","","","62","CCBYNCND","28 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Therefore, a novel deep transfer learning bearing fault diagnosis model is designed in this work by fusing time–frequency analysis, residual network (ResNet), and self-attention mechanism (SAM). A multiscale time–frequency feature map (MTFFM) and a global statistical feature matrix (GSFM) of vibration signals are first constructed using wavelet packet transform (WPT). A deep feature extraction network combining ResNet and SAM networks is then designed to realize the fused extraction of local and global time–frequency features. Finally, we construct a joint loss function by the combination of the multikernel maximum mean discrepancy (MK-MMD) and the domain adversarial neural network (DANN) to optimize the depth feature extraction network, which improves the cross-domain invariance and fault state discrimination of depth features. The proposed optimization method fully exploits the advantages of high-dimensional spatial distribution difference evaluation and gradient inversion adversarial strategy.

It is a crucial task that aids machine learning classifiers in reducing error rates, computation time, overfitting, and improving classification accuracy. It has demonstrated its efficacy in myriads of domains, ranging from its use for text classification (TC), text mining, and image recognition. While there are many traditional FS methods, recent research efforts have been devoted to applying metaheuristic algorithms as FS techniques for the TC task. However, there are few literature reviews concerning TC. Therefore, a comprehensive overview was systematically studied by exploring available studies of different metaheuristic algorithms used for FS to improve TC. This paper will contribute to the body of existing knowledge by answering four research questions (RQs): 1) What are the different approaches of FS that apply metaheuristic algorithms to improve TC? 2) Does applying metaheuristic algorithms for TC lead to better accuracy than the typical FS methods? 3) How effective are the modified, hybridized metaheuristic algorithms for text FS problems?, and 4) What are the gaps in the current studies and their future directions? These RQs led to a study of recent works on metaheuristic-based FS methods, their contributions, and limitations. Hence, a final list of thirty-seven (37) related articles was extracted and investigated to align with our RQs to generate new knowledge in the domain of study. Most of the conducted papers focused on addressing the TC in tandem with metaheuristic algorithms based on the wrapper and hybrid FS approaches.

We characterize servitization as services supporting products (SSP) and services supporting clients’ actions (SSC), and conceptualize organizational practices as organizational information processing capabilities comprising the use of different information technology (IT) tools, which include organizational IT (OIT) and social media (SM), and individual service-oriented cognition, which is manifested in service-oriented corporate culture (Culture). Based on a sample of 207 Chinese manufacturing firms, we find that while servitization does not necessarily enhance customer loyalty, successful servitization implementation depends on proper combinations of IT tools and Culture. Specifically, the SSP–OIT–Culture interaction and SSC–SM–Culture interaction are positively associated with customer loyalty. Our findings not only provide evidence against the conventional intuition that customer loyalty can be achieved by adopting servitization, but also explicitly show how to enhance customer loyalty by proper organizational practices, which provide new insights into both servitization and organizational information processing theory.","1558-0040","","10.1109/TEM.2021.3052561","National Social Science Fund of China(grant numbers:15ZDB150); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:71832011,71571140); Science and Technology Innovation Team Plan of Shaanxi Province(grant numbers:2020TD-006); Hong Kong Polytechnic University; Hong Kong Polytechnic University; Fung Yiu King – Wing Hang Bank Endowed Professorship in Business Administration; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9350218","Culture;customer loyalty;information processing;information technology;servitization;social media","Information processing;Cognition;Task analysis;Manufacturing;Social networking (online);Complexity theory;Uncertainty","customer services;manufacturing industries;organisational aspects;service industries","Chinese manufacturing firms;individual service-oriented cognition;information technology tools;joint effects;organizational information processing theory;organizational IT;service-oriented corporate culture;services supporting clients;services supporting products;servitization-customer loyalty link;servitized firms;social media;SSC-SM-culture interaction;SSP-OIT-culture interaction","","2","","97","IEEE","8 Feb 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Clustering for high-dimensional data, such as texts, images, and videos, remains a challenging task due to the existence of many noise features. The widely used methods for this issue focus on mining a effective pattern in high-dimensional data using some dimensionality reduction techniques before clustering. This strategy slightly mitigates the effects of irrelevant and redundant features, but cannot significantly improve the clustering performance because the captured pattern by dimensionality reduction is not directly related to the clustering task. In this paper, we propose a unified framework to achieve discriminative dimensionality reduction and fuzzy clustering for high-dimensional data simultaneously. The proposed framework not only utilizes the clustering results to directly guide or supervise the process of discriminative dimensionality reduction, but also controls the clustering fuzziness more easily by a $F$ -norm regularization term. An efficient optimization algorithm is exploited to address the objective function of our method, which is proved to converge to the local optimal solution in theory. We evaluate the proposed method on three large-scale fine-grained image datasets, including Birds, Flowers, and Cars, for clustering and retrieval two tasks. The experimental results on metrics ACC, NMI, ARI and Recall@K indicate that our method achieves the comparable performance over the state-of-the-art methods.","","978-1-6654-3858-2","10.1109/ICKG52313.2021.00062","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62137002,61937001,62176209,62176207,62106190,62050194); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9667759","fuzzy clustering;dimensionality reduction;optimization","Dimensionality reduction;Clustering algorithms;Feature extraction;Linear programming;Birds;Data mining;Automobiles","data mining;fuzzy set theory;learning (artificial intelligence);optimisation;pattern classification;pattern clustering","clustering technique;data mining;machine learning fields;high-dimensional data;dimensionality reduction techniques;clustering performance;clustering task;discriminative dimensionality reduction;clustering fuzziness;fuzzy c-means clustering;objective function","","","","37","IEEE","14 Jan 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

If they are used directly, it is not only computationally expensive but also difficult to obtain satisfactory results. Unsupervised feature selection is designed to reduce the dimension of data by finding a subset of features in the absence of labels. Many unsupervised methods perform feature selection by exploring spectral analysis and manifold learning, such that the intrinsic structure of data can be preserved. However, most of these methods ignore a fact: due to the existence of noise features, the intrinsic structure directly built from original data may be unreliable. To solve this problem, a new unsupervised feature selection model is proposed. The graph structure, feature weights, and projection matrix are learned simultaneously, such that the intrinsic structure is constructed by the data that have been feature weighted and projected. For each data point, its nearest neighbors are acquired in the process of graph construction. Therefore, we call them adaptive neighbors. Besides, an additional constraint is added to the proposed model. It requires that a graph, corresponding to a similarity matrix, should contain exactly  $c$  connected components. Then, we present an optimization algorithm to solve the proposed model. Next, we discuss the method of determining the regularization parameter  $\gamma $  in our proposed method and analyze the computational complexity of the optimization algorithm. Finally, experiments are implemented on both synthetic and real-world datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.","2168-2275","","10.1109/TCYB.2021.3087632","National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2018AAA0101902); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61772427,61502521,61751202); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9505625","Adaptive neighbor;dimensionality reduction;projection;unsupervised feature selection;weighted features","Feature extraction;Optimization;Manifolds;Data mining;Computational modeling;Task analysis;Manifold learning","computational complexity;data mining;feature extraction;graph theory;learning (artificial intelligence);matrix algebra;optimisation;pattern clustering;spectral analysis;unsupervised learning","data mining;data point;feature weighted;feature weights;fundamental problem;graph structure;high-dimensional data;intrinsic structure;manifold learning;noise features;projected adaptive neighbors;projection matrix;spectral analysis;unsupervised feature selection model;unsupervised methods","","4","","39","IEEE","3 Aug 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In real-time cases, traffic must sometimes be identified per-packet, and thus cannot rely on traffic flow data or statistical methods for identification. Payload-based signature matching is utilized for clear text data, but the manual creation of regular expression signatures is inefficient and humans can overlook key repeated patterns in unknown traffic. In this paper, we present our system, a Regular Expression Apriori Constructor (RExACtor), which combines sequential pattern data mining using the Apriori algorithm, frequency distribution tables from natural language processing, and pairwise sequence alignment from the Needleman-Wunsch scoring algorithm to automatically generate regular expression signatures for targeted protocols. This solution takes as input traffic PCAPs and uses a modular framework to output signatures or common substrings based on user configurations. Our encoding algorithm creates more specific signatures than previous systems and our results show an 11.8% reduction in heap allocation, making our solution more space efficient than the state of the art. We also provide an implementation of the Hyperscan scanning framework for regular expressions which outperforms packet filtering libraries like Snort used in previous work. RExACtor advances the state of the art as both an automatic signature generator and knowledge discovery toolbox by reducing overall dynamic memory allocation and providing a solution for per-packet, signature-based analysis.","2643-7929","978-1-6654-9550-9","10.1109/NCA53618.2021.9685959","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9685959","DPI;Data Mining;Traffic Classification;Protocol Signatures;Sequence Alignment","Protocols;Statistical analysis;Inspection;Encoding;Real-time systems;Natural language processing;Resource management","computer network management;computer network security;data mining;digital signatures;natural language processing;pattern classification;pattern matching;telecommunication traffic","stateless packet inspection;network management systems;packet classification solutions;particular application-layer protocols;traffic flow data;payload-based signature matching;clear text data;regular expression signatures;key repeated patterns;unknown traffic;regular expression apriori constructor;RExACtor;sequential pattern data mining;apriori algorithm;Needleman-Wunsch scoring algorithm;input traffic PCAP;output signatures;specific signatures;regular expressions;automatic signature generator;knowledge discovery toolbox;signature-based analysis;automatic regular expression signature generation","","2","","54","IEEE","31 Jan 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The main objectives of this paper are to determine the key success factors associated with the Sri Lankan 3PL industry and identify the interrelationships of these key success factors. A systematic literature review and expert opinions were used to identify the key success factors of the 3PL industry in Sri Lanka. In total 21 key success factors were obtained, and those key success factors were grouped into four categories as organization strategy, management, and process, human resources, and customer orientation. Q-sort technique was used to group key success factors into four categories. Decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL) method was used to capture the interactive relationships among the key success factors of 3PL service providers, and the casual effect map analyzed. Data were collected through questionnaires from middle and senior-level managers of 3PL firms. A total of eleven experts in the 3PL industry participated in the data collection process. The result shows that organization strategy is a core success factor since it has both high prominence and high interrelationship. Management and process were classified as driving factors since they had a low prominence but a high interrelationship. However, human resources and customer orientation had high prominence but low relationship, which are influenced by other factors and cannot be directly improved. The findings may assist managers to formulate long-term flexible decision strategies in their 3PL firms.","2613-8662","978-1-6654-0965-0","10.1109/SCSE53661.2021.9568354","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9568354","3PL;DEMATEL;interrelationship;key success factors","Industries;Systematics;Bibliographies;Supply chains;Decision making;Companies;Data collection","customer relationship management;decision making;human resource management;logistics;organisational aspects;sorting;strategic planning;supply chain management;sustainable development","3PL industry;3PL firms;third-party logistics service providers;interrelationship identification;cost-effectiveness;Sri Lanka;organization strategy;human resources;customer orientation;Q-sort technique;decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory;DEMATEL;casual effect map;data collection process;core success factor","","","","31","IEEE","25 Oct 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We take the rich interclass similarity relationship based on the deep local invariant descriptors from the data into account to optimize sampling strategies for mining informative samples. The method dynamically adjusts the margin between data points to better match the true similarity relationship between classes. Specifically, for images in a batch, we first obtain deep local descriptors and calculate the similarity matrix of the channel, pixel and spatial levels.

It extracts fine-grained sentiment information in user-generated reviews, as it aims at predicting the polarities towards predefined aspect categories or relevant entities in free text. Previous deep learning approaches usually rely on large-scale pre-trained language models and the attention mechanism, which applies the complete computed attention weights and does not place any restriction on the attention assignment. We argue that the original attention mechanism is not the ideal configuration for ABSA, as for most of the time only a small portion of terms are strongly related to the sentiment polarity of an aspect or entity. In this paper, we propose a masked attention mechanism customized for ABSA, with two different approaches to generate the mask. The first method sets an attention weight threshold that is determined by the maximum of all weights, and keeps only attention scores above the threshold. The second selects the top words with the highest weights. Both remove the lower score parts that are assumed to be less relevant to the aspect of focus. By ignoring part of input that is claimed irrelevant, a large proportion of input noise is removed, keeping the downstream model more focused and reducing calculation cost. Experiments on the Multi-Aspect Multi-Sentiment (MAMS) and SemEval-2014 datasets show significant improvements over state-of-the-art pre-trained language models with full attention, which displays the value of the masked attention mechanism. Recent work shows that simple self-attention in Transformer quickly degenerates to a rank-1 matrix, and masked attention may be another cure for that trend.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3142178","Research Innovation Team Fund from the Department of Education, Sichuan Province(grant numbers:18TD0026); Sichuan Science and Technology Program(grant numbers:2020YFG0168); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9676694","Sentiment analysis;attention mechanism;pre-trained language model;masked attention","Task analysis;Sentiment analysis;Bit error rate;Deep learning;Data mining;Transformers;Semantics","data mining;learning (artificial intelligence);natural language processing;text analysis","predefined aspect categories;relevant entities;previous deep learning;large-scale pre-trained language models;complete computed attention weights;attention assignment;original attention mechanism;ABSA;sentiment polarity;attention weight threshold;attention scores;lower score parts;MultiAspect MultiSentiment;state-of-the-art pre-trained language models;simple self-attention;unrestricted attention;need-masked attention mechanism focuses better;relevant parts;Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis;highly challenging tasks;natural language processing;fine-grained sentiment information;user-generated reviews","","7","","56","CCBY","11 Jan 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Multi-organ segmentation of clinical Computed Tomography (CT) images of the patient’s abdomen and magnetic resonance images (MRI) of the patient’s heart is a challenging task in medical image segmentation. The accurate segmentation of multiple organs is an important prerequisite for disease diagnosis and treatment planning. Methods: In this paper, we propose a new method based on multi-organ segmentation in CT images or MRI images; this method is based on the CNN-Transformer hybrid model, and on this basis, a progressive sampling module is added. Results: We performed multi-organ segmentation on CT images and MRI images provided by two public datasets, Synapse multi-organ CT dataset (Synapse) and Automated cardiac diagnosis challenge dataset (ACDC). By using Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) and Hausdorff_95 (HD95) as the evaluation metric for the Synapse dataset. For the Synapse dataset of CT images, the average DSC reached 79.76%, and the HD95 reached 21.55%. The DSC indicators of Kidney(R), Pancreas, and Stomach reached 80.77%, 59.84%, and 81.11%, respectively. The average DSC for the ACDC dataset of MRI images reaches 91.8%, far exceeding other state-of-the-art techniques. Conclusion: In this paper, we propose a multi-sampled vision transformer MPSHT based on the CNN-Transformer structure. The model has both the advantages of CNN convolutional network and Transformer, and at the same time, the addition of a progressive sampling module makes the model’s segmentation of organs more accurate, making up for the shortcomings of the previous CNN-Transformer hybrid model.","2168-2372","","10.1109/JTEHM.2022.3210047","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61772319,62002200,62202268,62272281); Shandong Provincial Science and Technology Support Program of Youth Innovation Team in Colleges(grant numbers:2021KJ069,2019KJN042); Yantai Science and Technology Innovation Development Plan(grant numbers:2022JCYJ031); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9903588","Convolutional neural network;segmentation;muti-organ;CNN-Transformer;CT;MRI","Image segmentation;Feature extraction;Transformers;Medical diagnostic imaging;Convolution;Data mining;Training","biological organs;biomedical MRI;cardiology;computerised tomography;diseases;image classification;image segmentation;kidney;medical image processing","multisampled vision transformer MPSHT;average DSC;Synapse dataset;progressive sampling module;MRI images;CT images;treatment planning;disease diagnosis;multiple organs;medical image segmentation;magnetic resonance images;clinical Computed Tomography images;multiple progressive sampling hybrid model multiorgan segmentation;previous CNN-Transformer hybrid model","Humans;Tomography, X-Ray Computed;Abdominal Cavity;Diagnosis, Computer-Assisted;Heart;Kidney","","","36","CCBYNCND","26 Sep 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A major effort of the Task is the IEA Recommended Practice for Forecast Solution Selection which is divided into 3 parts: (1) “Forecast Solution Selection Process”, (2) “Designing and Executing Forecasting Benchmarks and Trials”, and (3) “Evaluation of Forecasts and Forecast Solutions”. The group initially identified three key contributing factors for failing to get the optimal value from the forecasts: (1) the specification of the wrong forecast performance objectives in the forecast solution selection process, (2) the use of poorly designed benchmarks or trials to select a forecast solution for a user's application and (3) the use of non-optimal evaluation metrics to assess the performance of candidates or existing forecast solutions. For this year, we intend to update the guideline in the light of the experiences throughout the industry in its initial application, and after collecting this experience at 3 Open Space workshops. A fourth part will be added, extending the guideline to Measurements for Real-time Forecasting Applications. Another current activity of the task is the Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) benchmark. NWP model providers have been asked to run two well-measured sites. One is from the Wind Forecast Improvement Project 2 and represents a difficult case of mountain waves in the US, the other one is based on a week of data from an offshore wind farm in the Baltic. A common validation framework was developed for that case and is available from Github. Finally, we submitted a paper on the uncertainty propagation throughout the entire modelling chain, where we investigated the part of the uncertainty that is coming from the model, that of the model inputs, and the part that is weather related. The analysis is done separately for the planning phase, operational phase and market phase of the plant and forecast system.","","978-1-83953-681-6","10.1049/icp.2021.2605","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9770660","","","atmospheric techniques;decision making;forecasting theory;offshore installations;power engineering computing;weather forecasting;wind power plants","wind forecast improvements;forecast vendors;forecast users;actual forecasting situations;wrong forecast performance objectives;poorly designed benchmarks;existing forecast solutions;Real-time Forecasting Applications;Numerical Weather Prediction benchmark;Wind Forecast Improvement Project 2;forecast system;presentation coal exit;german national regulatory agency;International Energy Agency Wind Task 36;Wind Energy organises international collaboration;national weather centres","","","","","","9 May 2022","","","IET","IET Conferences"

This has several benefits such as easier maintenance and update of services. However, deploying a microservice-based application is often more complicated than a monolithic application. While a monolithic application can be deployed one at a time on a group of similar servers behind a load balancer, a microservice-based application consists of different microservices and each microservice usually has more than one runtime instance that needs to be configured and deployed. For a small number of microservices and applications, the deployment could be done manually. However, a large number of microservices are frequently observed in practice. In such cases, the deployment becomes cumbersome and error-prone and does not scale with the increased number of services. To cope with this problem, we present a systematic approach and the corresponding tool support for enabling the deployment of microservices to resources that have limited capacity. Hereby, we model and define the design space given the deployment parameters and automatically derive the feasible deployment solution. The approach is validated using a taxi-hailing system case study inspired by Uber which has spread all over the world in recent years.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3057582","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9348889","Automated deployments for microservices;capacitated task assignment problem (CTAP);deriving feasible microservice deployments;optimization algorithms","Containers;Computer architecture;Cloud computing;Servers;Scalability;Task analysis;Tools","business data processing","microservice architectures;microservice-based application;deployment parameters;microservice deployment alternatives","","11","","49","CCBY","5 Feb 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Overlaid upon while more sophisticated than the canonical membership lookup, multiset membership lookup emerges as a pivotal functionality in many computing and networking paradigms. The quest to achieve high-speed, high-accuracy lookup with limited memory cost makes lookup algorithm design a challenging task, particularly when the data items arrive as a stream. In this paper, we devise compact data structures and lookup algorithms that are amendable for hardware implementation, while guaranteeing high lookup accuracy and supporting interactive query processing. We first propose multi-hash color table, a variant of Bloom filter, to encode subset IDs compactly and map the ID of an item to its subset ID. We further construct a more balanced data structure called balanced multi-hash color table to improve the compactness by integrating the state-of-the-art load balancing technique. We complete our work by addressing the case of batch arrivals and design a batched recording algorithm optimizing the memory efficiency.

It uses the context information of video or image sequence to model the appearance and motion information of the target, so as to predict the motion state of the target and calibrate the position of the target. From the perspective of building models, target tracking algorithms can be divided into generative models and discriminant models; From the number of tracking targets, it can be divided into single target tracking and multi-target tracking. Target tracking integrates the theories and algorithms of image processing, machine learning, optimization and other fields. It is the premise and foundation to complete higher-level image understanding.The basic task of target tracking is to give the initial position of the target in a video sequence and continuously track and locate the target in each subsequent frame. In this process, a priori conditions such as the color, shape and size of the target will not be provided, that is, the tracking algorithm can track only by learning the target in the first frame. The traditional solution is to calculate the project similarity offline and save it in the system for algorithm call, but it can not make full use of the latest scoring data to reflect the change of user interest. To solve the above problems, a target tracking item similarity incremental update mechanism suitable for online applications is proposed, so that the recommendation system can update the similarity data between the corresponding item and other items in real time after the current user submits the item score, so that the recommendation system can recommend based on the latest item similarity data, To adapt to changes in user interests.","","978-1-6654-0902-5","10.1109/IPEC54454.2022.9777459","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9777459","moving target tracking;incremental update mechanism;user interest change","Computer vision;Target tracking;Machine learning algorithms;Computational modeling;Video sequences;Predictive models;Prediction algorithms","computer vision;image sequences;learning (artificial intelligence);recommender systems;target tracking;video signal processing","generative models;discriminant models;multitarget tracking;target tracking item similarity incremental update mechanism;item score;recommendation system;item similarity data;user interests;computer vision;image sequence;motion information;image processing;machine learning;optimization;project similarity offline;video sequence;scoring data","","","","7","IEEE","23 May 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Wildfires often occurred when the weather is hugely drought or hot. The government is desperate to enhance the ability of drones to respond to more severe and complex fires. The problem aims to obtain the optimal number and combination of two drones, ensuring communication efficiency. We simplify the communication task requirements among firefighters, drones, and EOC (Emergency Operations Center) and costs to a nonlinear programming problem. A PSO model is then used to evaluate the adaptation of each kind of the combination of two drones to the limitations. In this process, we introduce the violation degree function to avoid overly abandon possible combinations. After about 100 iterations, we converge to the optimal arrangement is 6 SSA and two repeater drones for each part of Victoria State. We need to find the optimal location of repeaters for fires of different sizes on different terrains. Because radio transmission paths are related to terrain. First, we defined the terrain complexity and then quantified it in relation to the drone communication range. Then we can take it as a dynamic planning problem. To get optimal solution, we use Q-learning algorithm to train the repeater drones when we consider the terrain complexity. Our goal is to make the information amount larger. The iteration result is as expected. The result show that the amount of information increase as time goes by, therefore, we can obtain the locally optimal solution under the given conditions.","","978-1-6654-7053-7","10.1109/TOCS56154.2022.10015980","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10015980","PSO;Q-Learning;Drones;Wildfire","Q-learning;Computational modeling;Fires;Programming;Repeaters;Complexity theory;Telecommunications","emergency management;emergency services;fires;nonlinear programming;optimisation;particle swarm optimisation;wireless sensor networks","ant colony algorithm;Australian people;communication efficiency;communication task requirements;complex fires;devastation;different terrains;drone communication range;dynamic planning problem;Emergency Operations Center;locally optimal solution;nonlinear programming problem;optimal arrangement;optimal number;PSO model;repeater drones;severe fires;terrain complexity;violation degree function;wildfire damage","","","","10","IEEE","18 Jan 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Contextual information is essential for text classification, and different words usually need different sizes of contextual information. However, most existing methods learn contextual features with predefined fixed sizes, which cannot extract the different sizes of contextual features for different words. To this end, we propose a new model named Deformable Self-Attention (DSA) to flexibly learn word-specific contextual features, rather than extracting features of fixed context sizes. Our model is mainly composed of a Deformable Local Attention Weight Generation (DLAWG) module and a Multi-Range Feature Integration (MRFI) module. The DLAWG module can adaptively determine different context sizes for different words within a particular range and then learn word-specific contextual features for each word. DLAWG then employs multiple ranges to capture context dependencies of different ranges. After that, the MRFI module integrates features from different ranges by considering the interactions with features of different ranges, which can delete irrelevant features while enhancing discriminative ones. Experiments on extensive benchmark datasets and visualizations illustrate the effectiveness of our model.","2329-9304","","10.1109/TASLP.2021.3067210","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61502174,61872148); Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province(grant numbers:2017A030313355,2017A030313358,2019A1515010768); Guangzhou Science and Technology Planning(grant numbers:201704030051,201902010020); Key R&D Program of Guangdong Province(grant numbers:2018B010107002); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9381705","Context modeling;feature integration;self-attention;text classification","Feature extraction;Context modeling;Data mining;Task analysis;Deformable models;Visualization;Stacking","data mining;feature extraction;learning (artificial intelligence);natural language processing;pattern classification;text analysis","fixed context;Deformable Self-Attention;predefined fixed sizes;contextual information;natural language processing;text classification;irrelevant features;word-specific contextual features;different context;DLAWG module;MultiRange Feature Integration module;Deformable Local Attention Weight Generation module","","5","","54","IEEE","18 Mar 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, the mining process requires high computational power, which prevents IoT devices from directly participating in blockchain construction. For this reason, edge computing service is introduced to help build the IoT blockchain, where IoT devices could purchase computational resources from the edge servers. In this paper, we consider the case that IoT devices also have other tasks that need the help of edge servers, such as data analysis and data storage. The profits they can get from these tasks is closely related to the amounts of resources they purchased from the edge servers. In this scenario, IoT devices will allocate their limited budgets to purchase different resources from different edge servers, such that their profits can be maximized. Moreover, edge servers will set “best” prices such that they can get the biggest benefits. Accordingly, there raise a pricing and budget allocation problem between edge servers and IoT devices. We model the interaction between edge servers and IoT devices as a multi-leader multi-follower Stackelberg game, whose objective is to reach the Stackelberg Equilibrium (SE). We prove the existence and uniqueness of the SE point, and design efficient algorithms to reach the SE point. In the end, we verify our model and algorithms by performing extensive simulations, and the results show the correctness and effectiveness of our designs.","2168-7161","","10.1109/TCC.2022.3150766","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:12071478); National Science Foundation(grant numbers:1907472); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9712423","Internet of Things;blockchain;edge computing;stackelberg game","Blockchains;Internet of Things;Servers;Task analysis;Games;Security;Edge computing","blockchains;computer network security;data analysis;data mining;data privacy;edge computing;game theory;Internet of Things;pricing","budget allocation problem;different edge servers;edge computing service;IoT blockchain;IoT devices;pricing","","4","","33","IEEE","14 Feb 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

It is concerned with identifying important words and phrases which can comprise a meaningful summary of the input text. Current unsupervised methods for key-phrase extraction do not explicitly account for the opinion expressing side of the text. This is important for certain type of data, for example, product reviews, since they contain user opinion about the product and its aspects. Therefore, the extracted key-phrases should reflect both factual information as well as the opinionated part of the text. In this paper, we present SubModRank, an unsupervised approach for automated key-phrase extraction, based on submodular function optimization, for which a partial enumeration based greedy algorithm has been used.

Despite the remarkable success, such architectures often suffer from high model complexity and time-consuming pretraining process, as well as the mismatches between the image classification-driven backbones and the reID task. To address these issues, we introduce neural architecture search (NAS) into automatically designing person reID backbones, i.e., reID-NAS, which is achieved via automatically searching attention-based network architectures from scratch. Different from traditional NAS approaches that originated for image classification, we design a reID-based search space as well as a search objective to fit NAS for the reID tasks. In terms of the search space, reID-NAS includes a lightweight attention module to precisely locate arbitrary pedestrian bounding boxes, which is automatically added as attention to the reID architectures. In terms of the search objective, reID-NAS introduces a new retrieval objective to search and train reID architectures from scratch. Finally, we propose a hybrid optimization strategy to improve the search stability in reID-NAS. In our experiments, we validate the effectiveness of different parts in reID-NAS, and show that the architecture searched by reID-NAS achieves a new state of the art, with one order of magnitude fewer parameters on three-person reID datasets. As a concomitant benefit, the reliance on the pretraining process is vastly reduced by reID-NAS, which facilitates one to directly search and train a lightweight reID model from scratch.","2162-2388","","10.1109/TNNLS.2021.3082701","National Science Fund for Distinguished Young Scholars(grant numbers:62025603); National Nature Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:U1705262,61972167,62072386,62072387,62072389,62002305,61772443,61802324,61702136); National Key Research and Development Program(grant numbers:2017YFC0113000,2016YFB1001503); Nature Science Foundation of Fujian Province, China(grant numbers:2017J01125,2018J01106); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(grant numbers:30918014108,20720200077,20720200090,20720200091); Basic and Applied Basic Research Foundation of Guangdong Province(grant numbers:2019B1515120049); Open Project Program of the National Laboratory of Pattern Recognition (NLPR)(grant numbers:202000012); Project of Guangxi Science and Technology(grant numbers:GuiKeAD21075030); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9444559","Attention;hybrid optimization;neural architecture search (NAS);person reidentification (reID);retrieval","Search problems;Task analysis;Computer architecture;Optimization;Training;Computational modeling;Feature extraction","deep learning (artificial intelligence);feature extraction;image classification;neural net architecture;search problems","attention-based network architectures;expert-designed deep neural network architectures;image classification;lightweight reID model;NAS approaches;neural architecture search;person reID backbones;person reidentification;reID architectures;reID task;reID-based search space;reID-NAS;three-person reID datasets","Humans;Biometric Identification;Neural Networks, Computer;Image Processing, Computer-Assisted;Pedestrians","2","","73","IEEE","31 May 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

It pushes the computational resources in close proximity to the data sources and thus, caters for the explosive growth of vehicular applications. Owing to the high mobility of vehicles, these applications are of latency-sensitive requirements in most cases. Accordingly, such requirements still pose a great challenge to the computing capabilities of VEC, when these applications are outsourced and executed in VEC. Against this backdrop, we propose a new mathematical model, which, respectively, generalizes the computation and communication models, and applies application-oriented caching into VEC in this article. Based on this model, a new strategy is further proposed to optimize the average response time of applications over an infinite time-slotted horizon for VEC. A long-term energy consumption constraint is imposed to guarantee the stability of the VEC system, and the Lyapunov optimization technology is adopted to tackle this constraint issue. Two greedy heuristics are put forward to help find the approximate optimal solution in the drift-plus-penalty-based algorithm. Extensive experiments have been conducted to evaluate the response time and energy consumption in the caching-assisted VEC. The simulation results have shown that the proposed strategy can dramatically optimize the average response time while satisfying the long-term energy consumption constraint.","2327-4662","","10.1109/JIOT.2021.3108902","National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2020YFB2104301); Chinese National Research Fund (NSFC) Key Project(grant numbers:61532013,61872239); Project “Network Communication Intelligent Core Chip Design and Core Software (PCL2021-A08),” and the Project “Beihang Beidou Technological Achievements Transformation and Industrialization Funds (BARI2005)”; FCT/MCTES through national funds and when applicable co-funded EU Funds(grant numbers:UIDB/50008/2020); Brazilian National Council for Research and Development (CNPq)(grant numbers:313036/2020-9); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9525145","Caching;greedy heuristics;Lyapunov optimization;service provisioning;vehicular edge computing (VEC)","Energy consumption;Time factors;Task analysis;Optimization;Outsourcing;Simulation;Servers","cache storage;distributed processing;energy consumption;greedy algorithms;minimisation;traffic engineering computing","response time minimization;caching-assisted vehicular edge computing;computational resources;latency-sensitive requirements;communication models;application-oriented caching;infinite time-slotted horizon;long-term energy consumption constraint;caching-assisted VEC system;Lyapunov optimization technology;greedy heuristics;drift-plus-penalty-based algorithm","","12","","29","IEEE","30 Aug 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, these methods often suffer the performance deterioration facing limited labeled data in real-world applications. To address this problem, a novel self-supervised semantic segmentation framework is proposed for remote sensing imageries with limited labeled data. Specifically, image inpainting is acted as pixel-level pretext task for learning dense feature representations suitable for semantic segmentation. Furthermore, rather than trivially leveraging the conventional random inpainting strategy, a novel adversarial training scheme is proposed to drive the pretext task to adaptively mask and restore salient local regions. The adversarial training scheme consists of instructor network and inpainting network, the instructor network increasingly predicts meaningful salient regions as erased regions, and meanwhile the inpainting network seeks for restoring the corrupted image as pretext task to learn its intrinsic representation. Moreover, the structural similarity (SSIM) is applied as a patch-level loss function for semantic segmentation considering that remote sensing images are highly structured. The experimental results on the International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing (ISPRS) Potsdam dataset demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art self-supervised methods and the ImageNet pre-training methods.

Firstly, the DEA model helps to filter out potentially and highly effective locations from feasible locations. Afterward, Fuzzy BWM is a worthy and effective alternative to Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) in weighting criteria. Finally, the simulation-based Fuzzy TODIM method evaluates potential locations, taking into account both the consideration of the criteria interaction and the decision maker’s aversion to loss. Based on the simulation results, the study finds the thresholds of the loss attenuation coefficient that change the ranking of potential locations. Last but not least, to validate the ranking result, the comparison shows that the proposed method’s results have a high degree of similarity with actual wave energy projects in Australia.

To evaluate the influence spread of a seed set efficiently, existing studies have proposed transformations with lower computational costs to replace the expensive Monte Carlo simulation process. These alternate transformations, based on network prior knowledge, induce different search behaviors with similar characteristics to various perspectives. Specifically, it is difficult for users to determine a suitable transformation a priori. This article proposes a multi-transformation evolutionary framework for influence maximization (MTEFIM) with convergence guarantees to exploit the potential similarities and unique advantages of alternate transformations and to avoid users manually determining the most suitable one. In MTEFIM, multiple transformations are optimized simultaneously as multiple tasks. Each transformation is assigned an evolutionary solver. Three major components of MTEFIM are conducted via: 1) estimating the potential relationship across transformations based on the degree of overlap across individuals of different populations, 2) transferring individuals across populations adaptively according to the inter-transformation relationship, and 3) selecting the final output seed set containing all the transformation's knowledge. The effectiveness of MTEFIM is validated on both benchmarks and real-world social networks. The experimental results show that MTEFIM can efficiently utilize the potentially transferable knowledge across multiple transformations to achieve highly competitive performance compared to several popular IM-specific methods. The implementation of MTEFIM can be accessed through the external link in the footnote.","1556-6048","","10.1109/MCI.2022.3222050","Key Scientific Technological Innovation Research Project; National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61621005); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61836009,91438201,91438103,91838303,U1701267,62076192,62006177,61902298,61573267,61906150); Higher Education Discipline Innovation Project; Program for Cheung Kong Scholars and Innovative Research Team in University(grant numbers:IRT 15R53); Chinese Ministry of Education; Key Research and Development Program in Shaanxi Province of China(grant numbers:2019ZDLGY03-06); National Science Basic Research Plan in Shaanxi Province of China(grant numbers:2019JQ-659,2022JQ-607); Scientific Research Project of Education Department In Shaanxi Province of China(grant numbers:20JY023); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(grant numbers:XJS201901,XJS201903,JBF201905,JB211908); CAAI-Huawei MindSpore Open Fund; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10026148","","Process design;Social networking (online);Social implications of technology;Process control;Benchmark testing;Computational efficiency;Statistics;Data mining;Deep learning","data mining;evolutionary computation;Monte Carlo methods;network theory (graphs);optimisation;social networking (online)","alternate transformations;computational costs;evolutionary solver;expensive Monte Carlo simulation process;final output seed;influence maximization;influence spread;influenced nodes;intertransformation relationship;MTEFIM;multitransformation evolutionary framework;network prior knowledge;potential similarities;potentially transferable knowledge;real-world social networks","","1","","66","IEEE","25 Jan 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

In addition, traditional CNN based models are plagued by the loss of long-range context information, and the high computational complexity brought by deep layers.

In the MSCANet, a CNN-based feature extractor is first utilized to capture hierarchical features, then a transformer-based MSCA is designed to encode and aggregate context information. Finally, a multibranch prediction head with three CNN classifiers is applied to obtain change maps, to enhance the supervision for deep layers. Besides, for the lack of CD dataset with fine-grained cropland change of interest, we also provide a new cropland change detection dataset, which contains 600 pairs of 512 × 512 bi-temporal images with the spatial resolution of 0.5–2m.

To this end, we tend to explore the abundant channel information of multispectral and SAR data as a supplement to the refined spatial features of VHR images.

Second, a feature selection method based on random forest is introduced to choose effective features from multispectral and SAR images. Finally, a multilevel heterogeneous feature fusion module is embedded in MSCDUNet to combine multifeatures for CD. Experiments are conducted on both the MSOSCD and the MSBC datasets.

Phase identification traditionally is executed manually, although there are existing voltage measurement based methods that are not always reliable. This paper develops a machine learning based data mining method for an accurate and efficient phase identification of residential customers in a distribution network by leveraging power consumption data collected through the advanced metering infrastructure (AMI). The proposed method uses a high-pass filter to remove the redundant and irrelevant parts of the power consumption time series, then identifies the residential customers' phase connectivity by proposing a modified clustering algorithm.

However, most existing subspace clustering methods consider data features as a whole and then focus only on one single self-representation. These approaches ignore the intrinsic multi-attribute information embedded in the original data feature and result in one–attribute self-representation. This paper proposes a novel multi-attribute subspace clustering (MASC) model that understands data from multiple attributes. MASC simultaneously learns multiple subspace representations corresponding to each specific attribute by exploiting the intrinsic multi-attribute features drawn from original data. In order to better capture the high-order correlation among multi-attribute representations, we represent them as a tensor in low-rank structure and propose the auto-weighted tensor nuclear norm (AWTNN) as a superior low-rank tensor approximation. Especially, the non-convex AWTNN fully considers the difference between singular values through the implicit and adaptive weights splitting during the AWTNN optimization procedure. We further develop an efficient algorithm to optimize the non-convex and multi-block MASC model and establish the convergence guarantees. A more comprehensive subspace representation can be obtained via aggregating these multi-attribute representations, which can be used to construct a clustering-friendly affinity matrix. Extensive experiments on eight real-world databases reveal that the proposed MASC exhibits superior performance over other subspace clustering methods.","1941-0042","","10.1109/TIP.2022.3220949","National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2021ZD0111902); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62172023,U21B2038,U19B2039); Beijing Natural Science Foundation(grant numbers:4222021); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9944936","Subspace clustering;multi-attribute representation learning;non-convex low-rank tensor approximation;auto-weighted tensor nuclear norm","Tensors;Optimization;Minimization;Correlation;Clustering methods;Task analysis;Sun","concave programming;matrix algebra;minimisation;pattern clustering;tensors;unsupervised learning","adaptive weights splitting;auto-weighted tensor nuclear norm minimization;clustering-friendly affinity matrix;comprehensive subspace representation;data features;implicit weights splitting;intrinsic multiattribute features;intrinsic multiattribute information;low-rank tensor approximation;MASC;multiattribute representations;multiple subspace representations;nonconvex AWTNN;novel multiattribute subspace clustering model;one-attribute self-representation;original data feature;self-expressiveness based subspace clustering methods;single self-representation;unsupervised learning tasks","","","","72","IEEE","10 Nov 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Conventional methods for conditional traffic estimation usually focus on supervised settings, which require a large amount of labeled training data. However, in many urban planning applications, the large amount of traffic data in a new city can be hard or impossible to acquire. To tackle the conditional traffic estimation problem in data scarcity situations, we formulate the problem as a spatial transfer generative learning problem. Compared to prior spatial transfer learning frameworks with only single source city, we propose to extracts knowledge from multiple source cities to improve the estimation accuracy and transfer stability, which is a technically more challenging task. As a solution, we propose a new cross-city conditional traffic estimation method — Spatially-Transferable Generative Adversarial Networks (STrans-GAN) with novel pre-training and fine-tuning algorithms. STransGAN preserves diverse traffic patterns from multiple source cities through traffic clustering, and incorporates meta-learning idea into the pre-training process to learn a well-generalized model. During fine-tuning, we propose to add a cluster matching regularizer to realize the flexible adaptation in different scenarios. Through extensive experiments on multiple-city datasets, the effectiveness of STrans-GAN is proved.","2374-8486","978-1-6654-5099-7","10.1109/ICDM54844.2022.00085","U.S. Department of Transportation; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10027643","Generative adversarial networks;meta learning;urban traffic estimation","Adaptation models;Transfer learning;Urban planning;Estimation;Clustering algorithms;Transportation;Training data","neural nets;pattern clustering;road traffic;town and country planning;traffic engineering computing;transportation","conditional traffic estimation problem;cross-city conditional traffic estimation method;data scarcity situations;labeled training data;multiple source cities;multiple-city datasets;single source city;spatial transfer generative learning problem;spatially-transferable generative adversarial networks;strans-gan;traffic clustering;traffic data;transfer stability;urban construction plans;urban plan deployment;urban planning applications;urban traffic estimation","","","","41","IEEE","1 Feb 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Unfortunately, the minable data publication is often implemented by publishers with limited privacy concerns such that the published dataset is minable by malicious entities. It prohibits minable data publication since the published data may contain sensitive information. Thus, it is urgently demanded to present some approaches and technologies for reducing the privacy leakage risks. To this end, in this paper, we propose an optimized sanitization approach for minable data publication (named as SA-MDP). SA-MDP supports association rules mining function while providing privacy protection for specific rules. In SA-MDP, we consider the trade-off between the data utility and the data privacy in the minable data publication problem. To address this problem, SA-MDP designs a customized particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm, where the optimization objective is determined by both the data utility and the data privacy. Specifically, we take advantage of PSO to produce new particles, which is achieved by random mutation or learning from the best particle. Hence, SA-MDP can avoid the solutions being trapped into local optima. Besides, we design a proper fitness function to guide the particles to run towards the optimal solution. Additionally, we present a preprocessing method before the evolution process of the customized PSO algorithm to improve the convergence rate. Finally, the proposed SA-MDP approach is performed and verified over several datasets. The experimental results have demonstrated the effectiveness and efficiency of SA-MDP.","2096-0654","","10.26599/BDMA.2022.9020007","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61932006); National Key R&D Program of China(grant numbers:2018AAA0100101); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9793357","data publication;data sanitization;association rules hiding;evolutionary algorithm","Data privacy;Privacy;Filtering;Sociology;Companies;Task analysis;Statistics","data mining;data privacy;particle swarm optimisation","SA-MDP;data utility;data privacy;minable data publication problem;optimized sanitization approach;data-driven tasks","","1","","32","","9 Jun 2022","","","TUP","TUP Journals"

To improve the session continuity, multiconnectivity and guard capacity mechanisms have been proposed recently. Multiconnectivity enables dynamic handover between multiple pre-established spatially-diverse links, while guard capacity reserves a fraction of radio resources for the already accepted sessions by ensuring that they will have sufficient provisions in case of link blockage. In this study, we combine the tools of queuing theory and stochastic geometry to develop a mathematical framework for capturing the joint operation of these two schemes as well as the features of mmWave radio propagation. The metrics are related to user- and system-centric performance including the system resource utilization and the new and ongoing session drop probabilities. Our results show that multiconnectivity benefits all of the considered parameters. However, the range of performance boost remains limited by the deployment density and the maximum supported degree of multiconnectivity. In its turn, guard capacity allows to further decrease the ongoing session drop probability at the expense of the new session drop probability and the system resource utilization. When implemented jointly with multiconnectivity, guard capacity does not produce noticeable negative effects on the system resource utilization as compared to its standalone use. Hence, one may prefer a joint implementation of these mechanisms for preserving the session continuity of users without compromising the resource utilization.","1939-9359","","10.1109/TVT.2021.3061906","Business Finland; Academy of Finland; RUDN University Strategic Academic Leadership Program; Konstantin Samouylov, supervision, project administration(grant numbers:19-07-00933); Eduard Sopin, mathematical model development(grant numbers:20-07-01064); Vyacheslav Begishev, visualization; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9362332","5G cellular systems;blockage mitigation;guard capacity;multiconnectivity;new radio technology;session continuity","Resource management;Measurement;Fading channels;Capacity planning;Vehicle dynamics;Receiving antennas;Propagation losses","5G mobile communication;millimetre wave communication;millimetre wave propagation;mobility management (mobile radio);probability;quality of service;queueing theory;stochastic processes","link blockage;mmWave radio propagation;system-centric performance;system resource utilization;multiconnectivity benefits;ongoing session drop probability;radio resources;guard capacity reserves;multiple pre-established spatially-diverse links;guard capacity mechanisms;5G New Radio technology;human-body blockage;millimeter wave links;millimeter-wave 5G NR systems;improved session continuity","","10","","39","IEEE","24 Feb 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, there exist two major issues in this pipeline: large intra-action variation due to task gap between classification and localization and noisy classification learning caused by unreliable pseudo training samples. In this paper, we propose a novel framework CRRC-Net, which introduces a co-supervised feature learning module and a probabilistic pseudo label mining module, to simultaneously address the above two issues. Specifically, the co-supervised feature learning module is applied to exploit the complementary information in different modalities for learning more compact feature representations. Furthermore, the probabilistic pseudo label mining module utilizes the feature distances from action prototypes to estimate the likelihood of pseudo samples and rectify their corresponding labels for more reliable classification learning.

There are two challenges for this setting: 1) The optimal trade-off between optimizing the RL signal and the behavior cloning (BC) signal changes on different states due to the variation of the action coverage induced by different behavior policies. Previous methods fail to handle this by only controlling the global trade-off. 2) For a given state, the action distribution generated by different behavior policies may have multiple modes. The BC regularizers in many previous methods are mean-seeking, resulting in policies that select out-of-distribution (OOD) actions in the middle of the modes. In this paper, we address both challenges by using adaptively weighted reverse Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence as the BC regularizer based on the TD3 algorithm. Our method not only trades off the RL and BC signals with per-state weights (i.e., strong BC regularization on the states with narrow action coverage, and vice versa) but also avoids selecting OOD actions thanks to the mode-seeking property of reverse KL. Empirically, our algorithm can outperform existing offline RL algorithms in the MuJoCo locomotion tasks with the standard D4RL datasets as well as the mixed datasets that combine the standard datasets.","2374-8486","978-1-6654-5099-7","10.1109/ICDM54844.2022.00012","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10027770","Offline Reinforcement Learning;Mixed Dataset;Reverse KL Divergence","Cloning;Reinforcement learning;Behavioral sciences;Data mining;Task analysis;Standards;Faces","behavioural sciences computing;data analysis;optimisation;reinforcement learning;signal processing","action distribution;adaptively weighted reverse Kullback-Leibler divergence;BC regularizer;BC signals;behavior cloning signal;global trade-off;mixed datasets;mode-seeking property;MuJoCo locomotion tasks;multiple behavior policies;offline reinforcement learning;offline RL algorithms;OOD actions;optimal trade-off;out-of-distribution actions;reverse KL regularizer;RL signal;standard D4RL datasets;TD3 algorithm","","","","42","IEEE","1 Feb 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Recently, residual-optimized BDE algorithms based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have achieved top performance. However, they fail to use a single model to accurately recover all frequency information encoded by missing significant bits at one time on challenging large bit-depth recovery tasks. In this paper, we redefine BDE residual recovery from the perspective of image frequency characteristics. On this basis, we propose an iterative residual feature optimization strategy, which provides an implicit error correction mechanism and improves training and inference efficiency. Furthermore, we design a simple but effective iterative residual feature refinement network (IRFRN). By linking model complexity with the recovery of different frequency information, IRFRN enables a single model to simultaneously recover the missing low and high frequency information.

A dual-armed cluster tool consists of multiple processing modules (PMs), one material handling robot that can hold two wafers at the same time, and loadlocks where wafer cassettes are loaded or unloaded. The swap sequence in a dual-armed cluster tool is widely used in practice and known to be optimal with deterministic processing times when the bottleneck PM’s workload is larger than the robot workload. However, in practice, processing times on a PM can have a small variation, which leads to a different processing time of each wafer on the PM. Hence, when the processing time variation is introduced, the performance of the swap sequence needs to be analyzed. This paper first defines a fundamental cycle and analyzes its cycle time. It then proposes optimality conditions of the swap sequence and performs numerical experiments to show the effectiveness of the sequence. Note to Practitioners—A dual-armed cluster tool used for semiconductor manufacturing processes is usually operated with a swap sequence because it is simple, easy to control, and proven to be optimal with deterministic processing times. However, studies on the performance of the swap sequence are still limited with processing times varying in PMs which often occur in practice. Hence, this study shows the effectiveness of the swap sequence with the processing time variations by analyzing cycle times, optimality conditions, and performing numerical experiments.","1558-3783","","10.1109/TASE.2022.3203408","Korean Government(grant numbers:2022R1A2C4001978,2022R1F1A1059500); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9885027","Dual-armed cluster tool;performance analysis;processing time variation;semiconductor manufacturing;swap sequence","Robots;Task analysis;Schedules;Time factors;Delays;Semiconductor device modeling;Clustering algorithms","","","","","","","IEEE","9 Sep 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

We have designed and optimized a machine learning-based framework using inpatient’s facility data that will give a user-friendly, cost-effective, and time-efficient solution to this pandemic. The proposed framework uses Bayesian optimization to optimize the hyperparameters of the classifier and ADAptive SYNthetic (ADASYN) algorithm to balance the COVID and non-COVID classes of the dataset. Although the proposed technique has been applied to nine state-of-the-art classifiers to show the efficacy, it can be used to many classifiers and classification problems. It is evident from this study that eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGB) provides the highest Kappa index of 97.00%. Compared to without ADASYN, our proposed approach yields an improvement in the kappa index of 96.94%. Besides, Bayesian optimization has been compared to grid search, random search to show efficiency. Furthermore, the most dominating features have been identified using SHapely Adaptive exPlanations (SHAP) analysis. A comparison has also been made among other related works.

Obtaining accurate electricity consumption predictions in this highly uncertain period is particularly important for building operators to improve the corresponding operational planning efficacy. Nevertheless, developing accurate electricity consumption prediction models for buildings within the COVID-19 context is a nontrivial task. Correspondingly, this research focuses on incorporating publicly available internet data (i.e., Google Trends, Google Mobility, and COVID-19 data) to develop accurate electricity consumption prediction models for microgrid-based buildings during the COVID 19 pandemic. For this purpose, we developed extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), support vector regression (SVR), and autoregressive integrated moving average with explanatory variable (ARIMAX) models. As a case study, we analyzed a real-life electricity consumption dataset of a six-floor microgrid-designed educational building at a technological university in Bandung, West Java, Indonesia. The findings show that incorporating publicly online data positively impacts prediction accuracy. The accuracy increases, even more when we use the lagged value of the predictors. XGBoost models utilizing lagged historical values of the electricity consumption, Google Trends, and COVID-19 data of the previous days is the best performing model. However, adding more lagged predictors does not necessarily increase SVR models’ accuracy.

Integrating Artificial Intelligence into the BIoE is essential for big data analysis and intelligent decision-making. Typically, using deep learning to predict energy consumption and detect abnormal energy usage is gaining growing interest in BIoE. However, most models use supervised learning and, thus, require data annotation for model training. This is a tough and costly task, which is often performed by experts. This paper proposes an intelligent Anomaly Detection of Energy Consumption approach using an improved two-stage, hybrid supervised-unsupervised learning process. Specifically, to detect abnormal energy consumption, our methodology identifies the anomalies by analyzing the shape of daily energy usage curves themselves instead of the consumption values. Thus, energy consumption profiles were split into weekday and weekend classes. Then, eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) is adopted to build a regression model that enables labeling consumption anomalies of the weekdays class using a rule-based algorithm and residuals. Following, unsupervised anomaly detection is conducted using an Isolation Forest algorithm. Next, the abnormalities detected from the two stages are combined. The empirical evaluation of the proposed scheme illustrates promising anomaly detection accuracy, which has reached 95.93%.","2831-3844","978-1-6654-9265-2","10.1109/ICSPIS57063.2022.10002641","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10002641","Anomaly Detection;Building Internet of Things (BIoT);XGBoost;Isolation Forest;Deep Learning","Deep learning;Training;Energy consumption;Biological system modeling;Buildings;Signal processing algorithms;Forestry","building management systems;data analysis;data mining;deep learning (artificial intelligence);edge computing;energy consumption;energy management systems;Internet of Things;regression analysis;supervised learning;unsupervised learning","abnormal energy consumption;abnormal energy usage;anomaly detection accuracy;artificial intelligence;big data analysis;BIoE;building transformation;consumption values;costly task;daily energy usage curves;deep learning;edge-based building Internet of things applications;energy consumption approach;energy consumption profiles;extreme gradient boosting;intelligent anomaly detection;intelligent decision-making;labeling consumption anomalies;model training;rule-based algorithm;supervised learning;supervised-unsupervised learning process;tough task;two-stage energy anomaly detection;unsupervised anomaly detection;XGBoost","","","","34","IEEE","2 Jan 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This paper proposes a comment-guided semantics-aware image aesthetics assessment method, which is built upon a multi-task learning framework for image aesthetics prediction and comment-guided semantics classification. To assist image aesthetics assessment, we first model the semantics of an image as the topic features of its corresponding comments using Latent Dirichlet Allocation. We then propose a two-stream multitask learning framework for both topic feature prediction and aesthetic score distribution prediction. Topic feature prediction task enables to infer the semantics from images, since the comments are usually unavailable during inference and comment-guided semantics can only serve as supervision during training. We further propose to deeply fuse aesthetics and semantic features using a layerwise feature fusion method.

However, esti-mating mutual information is a notoriously tricky task, especially for high-dimensional stochastic variables. Recently, mutual information neural estimation (MINE) was proposed as a non-parametric method to estimate mutual information for contin-uous variables without discretization. Unfortunately, MINE also produces signifi-cant errors for high-dimensional variables. Analyzing the activity of neural networks requires a dimensionality reduction mechanism, with the resulting low-dimensional representations retaining as much information as possible. We investigated different dimensionality reduction methods to determine their capabilities in estimating mutual information regarding the activity of trained neural networks. We combined MIME with principal component analysis (PCA), a convolutional neural network (CNN), and global average pooling (GAP). The experiments showed that introducing dimensionality reduction provides more stable results than the baseline method. In terms of stability, PCA-MINE and GAP-MINE performed better than CNN-MINE. They also require much less computation time than CNN. Another advantage of GAP-MINE is that it requires no hyperparameter optimization. However, the results suggested that GAP-MINE may underestimate mutual information.","2375-0359","978-1-6654-7893-9","10.1109/DCC52660.2022.00088","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9810699","","Dimensionality reduction;Deep learning;Neural networks;Estimation;Stability analysis;Convolutional neural networks;Task analysis","convolutional neural nets;deep learning (artificial intelligence);principal component analysis;stochastic processes","GAP-MINE;information preserving dimensionality reduction;mutual information analysis;information bottleneck theory;mutual information;high-dimensional stochastic variables;mutual information neural estimation;dimensionality reduction mechanism;dimensionality reduction methods;convolutional neural network;principal component analysis;global average pooling;hyperparameter optimization","","","","0","IEEE","4 Jul 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, to extract discriminative yet domain-invariant representations, we propose the meta-generalized speaker verification (MGSV) via meta-learning. Specifically, we propose a metric-based distribution optimization and a gradient-based meta-optimization to simultaneously supervise the spatial relationship between embeddings and improve the generalization ability of the model on unseen domains. In addition, we design multiple-single (MS) and simulated speaker verification (SSV) sampling strategies based on single-domain (SD) and single-single (SS) strategies to simulate the train/test domain mismatch more relevantly, thereby mining transferable speaker-related knowledge. SSV is chosen as the most effective method, as it substantially improves the domain generalization by ensuring that the model has learned to discriminate efficiently. Additionally, to intuitively reflect the model performance on the unseen domains, the proposed method is validated on cross-genre, cross-device, and cross-dataset tasks. The experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method achieves remarkable performance in handling domain mismatch issues in speaker verification.","2329-9304","","10.1109/TASLP.2023.3244518","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62176182); Agency for Science, Technology and Research; CRF Core Project Scheme(grant numbers:CR-2021-005); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10053562","Domain mismatch;meta-learning;meta-generalized speaker verification;Speaker verification","Performance evaluation;Recording;Task analysis;Speech processing;Optimization","gradient methods;optimisation;signal representation;signal sampling;speaker recognition;supervised learning","ASV;automatic speaker verification;domain-invariant representations;domain-invariant speaker verification;gradient-based metaoptimization;metageneralized speaker verification;metalearning;metric-based distribution optimization;MGSV;simulated speaker verification sampling strategies;single-domain strategies;single-single strategies;speaker-related knowledge;speaking styles","","2","","63","IEEE","24 Feb 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

There are two limitations when applying advanced detection methods naively for SAR ship detection. First, most detectors construct the model as an encoder and rely on the feature pyramid network (FPN) head for accurate prediction, which may lead to high computational costs. Second, the background noises in the ground truth (annotated as rectangular bounding boxes) of angular ships bring difficulties for model training. To meet these challenges, we propose an efficient encoder–decoder network with estimated direction for ship detection in SAR images. First, we present an anchor-free encoder–decoder model that can efficiently extract multiple-level features. Second, we formulate ship detection as a multitask learning problem, including a bounding box prediction and a ship direction regression. The estimated ship direction can weakly supervise and benefit ship detection. Furthermore, we develop a center-weighted labeling method for overlapped annotations.

To that end, the research team has developed a mathematical model that applies machine learning to predict the effective process parameters. Since predicting process parameters requires a regression model, this research uses regression analysis algorithms such as the ridge regression and the random forest regressor. The paper analyzes whether these algorithms are applicable to the problem and tests the accuracy of their predictions. To generalize the approach and strengthen the justification of choosing the hyperparameters of the regression algorithms studied herein and considering the high variability of these hyperparameters, the multiobjective optimization technique applicable for this combinatorial problem - an (evolutionary) genetic algorithm - is proposed to determine effective sets of hyperparameters. All the models successfully addressed the task, achieving a forecasting accuracy of at least 89%. The article presents the final form of the ridge regression model describing the dependence of the weld’s depth and width: for the weld depth, there is a 2nd degree polynomial dependence with a regularization of 10−5, and for the weld width, there is a 3rd degree polynomial dependence with a regularization of 10−4. An automated system based on this approach that accurately predicts the process parameters is proposed herein. In addition to performing basic modeling functions, the proposed system allows the visualization of the model-predicted data in the form of an interactive plot. This function could be useful for technologists by allowing them to determine the process parameters that ensure the required weld dimensions. Adopting the proposed EBW parameter prediction method in practice will provide decision support for cases when engineers need to test the EBW process or to start making new products.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3092221","Ministry of Science and Higher Education of the Russian Federation “Development of the Theory of Self-Configuring Machine Learning Algorithms for Modeling and Predicting the Characteristics of Components of Complex Systems”(grant numbers:FEFE-2020-0013); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9464340","Electron beam welding;choice of process parameters;software;decision support;prediction;ridge regression;random forest;genetic algorithm;algorithm ensembles;machine learning","Welding;Prediction algorithms;Electron beams;Predictive models;Correlation;Random forests;Testing","electron beam welding;genetic algorithms;learning (artificial intelligence);polynomials;production engineering computing;regression analysis","electron beam welding;regression analysis algorithms;genetic algorithm;ridge regression model;weld depth;weld width;weld dimensions;EBW parameter prediction method;EBW process;multiobjective optimization technique","","15","","37","CCBY","24 Jun 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Due to the ongoing pandemic, nearly all businesses have adapted working models with remote operations. People engaged with major industries, e.g., academia, health and municipalities are utilizing online platforms to carryout their routine tasks. This indeed shifts the attention from one-to-one (unicast) communication to one-to-many (multicast) and many-to-many (multi-source multi-destination) communications. Network operators are facing increased pressure to provide quick responses in order to satisfy the bandwidth hungry and time sensitive user demands. This can only be done by enhancing deployability as well as manageability of the services. Network Function Virtualization (NFV) provides a transformation of traditional proprietary network designs to a more agile and software based environment in order to achieve flexible deployments, reduced setup costs and less-time-to-market for the new services which is very much needed in the current scenarios. Previous studies on NFV-enabled multicast problem either proposed Integer Linear Program (ILP) models, that are pretty unscalable, or heuristic-based techniques that do not guarantee good quality of the solutions obtained. In this article, we propose an NFV multicast resource optimization model exploiting the use of multiple sources and considering the end-to-end delay and bandwidth requirements. Herein, we propose a novel Dantzig-Wolfe (DW) decomposition model that tackles the complexity of the problem by breaking it down into a master problem and several pricing problems. We compare the DW approach with the ILP and heuristic methods and demonstrate that our approach achieves near to optimal solution (in comparison to heuristic based methods) much faster than ILP. We also study the dynamic admission of NFV-enabled multicast requests by solving the problem in an online manner using the batch processing of requests.

So on recursively, pattern nodes are formed for all elements of the nodes, and corresponding templates are generated to finally achieve the purpose of log pattern mining. The mining process of the log patterns is from coarse to fine which is based on fewer assumptions, and the pattern fitting depth can be controlled by adjusting the termination condition. In optimized algorithm model, we also consider the maximum extent of the log template matching the token in the log message.

Besides, the classical unsupervised sparse constraint weakens the evaluation of feature importance and neglects the preservation of discriminant information during sparse representation. To solve these issues, a novel fuzzy discriminative block representation learning (FDBRL) algorithm is proposed for image feature extraction. FDBRL aims to enhance the discriminability of subspace by designing effective constraints for projection learning. Specifically, based on the label information and the fuzzy relation between data, we construct a fuzzy block weight matrix and embed it into the  ${l_{2,1}}$  norm regularization term to realize supervised sparse constraint for the representation learning. Next, the low-rank constraint is used to capture the inherent global structure information of data. Finally, we introduce a classification loss term with transformation matrix for joint optimization, such that the projection learning is not limited to number of classes, and the discriminative ability is further improved.

With an ageing workforce and plant infrastructure, process plants need a means of ensuring the performance of their facilities in order to remain competitive. One approach is through more widespread and effective process and equipment monitoring to detect anomalies or identify opportunities for plant efficiency improvements. Monitoring tasks in process automation are classified as noncritical measurements that have no immediate impact on the business. Being non-critical, slow to develop and with a deferred impact, measurements for monitoring are often hard to justify. In many instances, such measurements are taken manually in a scheduled manner. Following this approach, operators have to live with the trade-off between manpower costs and the effectiveness and coverage of the checks. This approach, therefore, cannot be scaled up without dramatic cost increases. Indeed, the advent of a technology that is competitive with manpower costs would be the enabler for the more widespread use of monitoring technologies. In this paper, we present an approach to analyze cost-benefit structures that can be used to help guide the development of sensing solutions for monitoring applications. The approach is applied to the widespread and relevant example of pump aggregate monitoring. As a result, cost targets for sensor developments are identified. Relevance and some peculiarities of the use of low-cost sensing (LCS) elements are briefly discussed, as well as trends of recent product developments.","","978-1-7281-9690-9","10.1109/SA51175.2021.9507167","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9507167","sensors;monitoring;optimization;pumps;vibrations;cost-benefit analysis;digitalization;Industry 4.0","Industries;Process control;Manuals;Market research;Product development;Sensors;Proposals","computerised monitoring;cost reduction;cost-benefit analysis;industrial plants;product development;production engineering computing;production equipment;soft sensors","digitalization;sensor usage;ageing workforce;plant infrastructure;process plants;equipment monitoring;plant efficiency improvements;task monitoring;process automation;sensor developments;low-cost sensing elements;product developments;process industries;anomaly detection;cost-benefit structure analysis;LCS elements;Industry 4.0","","1","","14","IEEE","13 Aug 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

As all these algorithms contain complicated optimization procedure and matrix calculation procedure, complexity of these algorithms is very high. To overcome the shortage described above, in this paper, a new clustering algorithm is proposed. In this algorithm, several parameters should be inputted. These parameters include a heterogeneous information network, meta-paths that are used and the names of target types. During the clustering procedure, a homogeneous network will be built by the proposed algorithm firstly. All the target objects of HIN are treated as nodes of this network. The instances of meta-paths are edges. After the homogeneous network is constructed, label propagation procedure can be performed. Then the clustering result will be obtained. Obviously, by using the proposed algorithm to perform clustering, the complex optimization procedure and matrix calculation procedure are eliminated. As the convergence rate of label propagation procedure is fast, the proposed algorithm is very efficient. Besides, we can find that label propagation procedure can be executed in parallel. Thus, the proposed algorithm is easy to be parallelized. In this situation, it is fit for processing large scale HIN based on server cluster.

The idea of spatial crowdsourcing is recruiting a set of available crowds to finish the spatial tasks located in crowdsourcing locations, e.g., landmarks, by using their handheld devices. This paper addresses the worker recruitment problem in spatial crowdsourcing under the coverage and workload-balancing requirements. The coverage constraint means that any crowdsourcing location should be visited by at least one of the recruited workers to satisfy the Quality-of-Service requirement, e.g., traffic monitoring or climate forecast. In addition, we argue that each crowdsourcing operation has a cost in reality, e.g., data traffic or energy consumption and the resource may be limited at each crowdsourcing location. The objective of this paper is to solve a Coverage and Balanced Crowdsourcing Recruiting (CBCR) problem, which ensures the coverage requirement and minimizes the maximum crowdsourcing cost for any crowdsourcing location. We prove that the CBCR problem is NP-hard in the general case. Then, we discuss the CBCR problem in the 1-D scenario. In the 1-D scenario, we first propose a directionally coverage scheme and further extend it to a Polynomial-Time Approximation Scheme (PTAS) to trade-off the computation complexity and the performance. The performance can be bounded to 2 + ε, where ε can be an arbitrary small value. Then, we found that there exists a sub-optimal structure, and thus the dynamic programming approach is proposed to find the optimal solution in the 1-D scenario. In the general 2-D scenario, we first prove that it has a sub-modular property and thus the naive greedy algorithm has an approximation ratio of ln n + 1. In addition, we propose a randomized rounding algorithm with an expectation bound of O(logn / log logn). Extensive experiments on realistic traces demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.","2332-7790","","10.1109/TBDATA.2018.2865755","National Science Foundation(grant numbers:CNS 1757533,CNS 1629746,CNS 1564128,CNS 1449860,CNS 1461932,CNS 1460971,IIP 1439672); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8438972","Mobile edge computing;spatial crowdsourcing;task allocation;mobile networks","Crowdsourcing;Task analysis;Trajectory;Sensors;Big Data;Wireless sensor networks;Recruitment","approximation theory;business data processing;computational complexity;crowdsourcing;dynamic programming;greedy algorithms;mobile computing;recruitment","coverage requirement;spatial crowdsourcing;spatial tasks;workload-balancing requirements;crowdsourcing location;recruited workers;crowdsourcing operation;crowdsourcing cost;CBCR problem;heterogeneous worker recruitment;Coverage and Balanced Crowdsourcing Recruiting;Quality-of-Service requirement;mobile devices;polynomial-time approximation scheme;dynamic programming;randomized rounding algorithm","","14","","41","IEEE","17 Aug 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Text-documents classification is a key task in natural language processing that converts unstructured data into structured form and then extract knowledge from it. This conversion generates a high dimensional data that needs further analysis using data mining techniques like feature extraction, feature selection, and classification to derive meaningful insights from the data. Feature selection is a technique used for reducing dimensionality in order to prune the feature space and, as a result, lowering the computational cost and enhancing classification accuracy. This work presents a hybrid filter-wrapper method based on Principal Component Analysis (PCA) as a filter approach to select an appropriate and informative subset of features and Grey Wolf Optimizer (GWO) as wrapper approach (PCA-GWO) to select further informative features. Logistic Regression (LR) is used as an elevator to test the classification accuracy of candidate feature subsets produced by GWO. Three Arabic datasets, namely Alkhaleej, Akhbarona, and Arabiya, are used to assess the efficiency of the proposed method. The experimental results confirm that the proposed method based on PCA-GWO outperforms the baseline classifiers with/without feature selection and other feature selection approaches in terms of classification accuracy.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3222516","UoS(grant numbers:2102150206); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9953074","Arabic text classification;feature selection;grey wolf optimizer;principal component analysis;logistic regression","Feature extraction;Text categorization;Support vector machines;Principal component analysis;Task analysis;Logistics;Data mining;Water resources","data mining;feature extraction;natural language processing;optimisation;pattern classification;principal component analysis;regression analysis;text analysis","Arabic news article classification;candidate feature subsets;computational cost;electronic documents;enhancing classification accuracy;feature extraction;feature space;Grey Wolf Optimizer algorithm;high dimensional data;hybrid feature selection;hybrid filter-wrapper method;informative features;natural language processing;PCA-GWO;Principal Component Analysis;selection approaches;text-documents classification;unstructured data","","","","89","CCBY","16 Nov 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A recent research effort of ours put forth a new IFDMA transceiver design significantly less complex than conventional IFDMA transceivers. The new IFDMA transceiver design reduces the complexity by exploiting a certain correspondence between the IFDMA signal processing and the Cooley-Tukey IFFT/FFT algorithmic structure so that IFDMA streams can be inserted/extracted at different stages of an IFFT/FFT module according to the sizes of the streams. Although our prior work has laid down the theoretical foundation for the new IFDMA transceiver’s structure, the practical realization of the transceiver on specific hardware with resource constraints has not been carefully investigated. This paper is an attempt to fill the gap. Specifically, this paper puts forth a heuristic algorithm called multi-priority scheduling (MPS) to schedule the execution of the butterfly computations in the IFDMA transceiver with the constraint of a limited number of hardware processors. The resulting FFT computation, referred to as MPS-FFT, has a much lower computation time than conventional FFT computation when applied to the IFDMA signal processing. Importantly, we derive a lower bound for the optimal IFDMA FFT computation time to benchmark MPS-FFT. Our experimental results indicate that when the number of hardware processors is a power of two: 1) MPS-FFT has near-optimal computation time; 2) MPS-FFT incurs less than 44.13% of the computation time of the conventional pipelined FFT.","1558-2248","","10.1109/TWC.2023.3244553","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10049776","IFDMA;FFT;precedence graph;task scheduling","Task analysis;Program processors;Transceivers;Hardware;Schedules;Data mining;Wireless communication","","","","","","","IEEE","22 Feb 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

The previous approaches to core maintenance face challenges in terms of storage and efficiency. In this article, we investigate distributed approaches to core maintenance on a pregel-like system, which is a famous graph computing system. We first design a core decomposition algorithm to obtain core numbers of vertices in a given graph. Based on it, a distributed batch-stream combined algorithm (DBCA) is devised to efficiently maintain the core numbers when vertex/edge updates happen. In particular, we introduce a new task assignment strategy to DBCA based on diversity of the edge-cores of updated edges. To ensure that DBCA can accurately process core maintenance, we develop a message interaction protocol to resolve the problem of crosstalk among different tasks.

So, if those who operate tourism businesses and government agencies that govern tourism-related policies can understand what social media is talking about. It will be very useful in clarifying, understanding, developing, improving, as well as looking for opportunities for the tourism business in the future, but social media data is large unstructured data and difficult to manipulate by humans. Therefore, our idea was to study the classification of tourism opinion topics using the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) technique and to develop a digital platform for displaying the classification and trends of tourism opinion topics. Phuket is suitable as a case study because Phuket is one of the country's top tourism income earners, thus being regarded as an important area in Thailand's tourism industry. The aim of this study is to develop a digital platform, which will enable stakeholders to understand the underlying issues and interests of the online community and show trends in opinion issues from the past to the present that can be used to develop, improve, and seek new opportunities in tourism.

Hiring domain experts to annotate a corpus is very costly in terms of money and time. Crowdsourcing platforms, such as Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT), have been deployed to assist in this purpose. However, the annotations collected this way are prone to human errors due to the lack of expertise of the crowd workers. Existing literature in annotation aggregation assumes that annotations are independent and thus faces challenges when handling the sequential label aggregation tasks with complex dependencies. To conquer the challenges, we propose an optimization-based method that infers the ground truth labels using annotations provided by workers for sequential labeling tasks. The proposed Aggregation method for Sequential Labels from Crowds (AggSLC) jointly considers the characteristics of sequential labeling tasks, workers’ reliabilities, and advanced machine learning techniques. Theoretical analysis on the algorithm’s convergence further demonstrates that the proposed AggSLC halts after a finite number of iterations. We evaluate AggSLC on different crowdsourced datasets for Named Entity Recognition (NER) tasks and Information Extraction tasks in biomedical (PICO), as well as a simulated dataset. Our results show that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art aggregation methods.

As the number of orders and robots increases, congestion is witnessed in the warehouse that invalidates fixed travel costs assumptions. To facilitate research in warehousing we first propose a modular simulator for the warehouse that simulates the business operations of order generation, order fulfillment scheduling, item picking, and sorting. The simulator also models the robots for traveling within the warehouse network, scheduling charging, intersection management, and congestion management. With the increasing demand, the warehouses increase the number of robots making the transportation network operate beyond capacity. In this direction, we analyze the performance of the warehouse from a transportation perspective using fundamental diagrams. The warehouses contain only controllable entities (robots) that enable predicting the congestion levels for solving the planning problem. The results show improvements of around 5% in the order fulfillment time and the number of picks that can significantly increase the profitability of the warehouse.","2161-8089","978-1-6654-9042-9","10.1109/CASE49997.2022.9926624","Indian Institute of Technology Delhi; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9926624","","Costs;Profitability;Warehousing;Transportation;Routing;Planning;Task analysis","data warehouses;mobile robots;operations research;optimisation;production engineering computing;road traffic;scheduling;telecommunication congestion control;transportation;warehouse automation;warehousing","modern-day warehouses;warehouse processes;warehouse network","","1","","17","IEEE","28 Oct 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Deeping learning has been widely exploited in scene classification and achieved high classification accuracy. However, current the scene classification method based on deep learning depends on a large number of datasets for training, and the feature distribution of the default testing datasets is the same as that of the training datasets. In practical application, it is not only time-consuming and laborious to obtain a large number of training data, but also difficult to meet these needs due to the data shift between different domain. In addition, directly use of features extracted by the convolutional neural network (CNN) will lead to limited performance owing to the influence of domain migration. Therefore, how to effectively reduce the domain offset between the training data and the testing data, and discover discriminative information to scene classification is a challenging task. In this paper, the SSCN is proposed for HSR remote Sensing cross-domain scene classification. In SSCN, we introduce DSAN in which the local maximum mean discrepancy (LMMD) is first introduced for scene classification to capture the fine-grained information for each category and reduce the domain migration between training data and testing data. To extract more discriminative information from HSR images, a style normalization and restitution module (SNR) is developed, and an attention mechanism is added to the module to improve the performance of the model. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed SSCN framework is superior to the state-of-the-art methods 1 and performs well for cross-domain scene classification.","2153-7003","978-1-6654-2792-0","10.1109/IGARSS46834.2022.9884646","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:41901306); State Key Laboratory of Resources and Environmental Information System; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9884646","Cross-domain scene classification;domain adaptation;feature compensation;remote sensing scene classification","Training;Image analysis;Urban planning;Training data;Feature extraction;Data mining;Convolutional neural networks","expectation-maximisation algorithm;feature extraction;geophysical image processing;image classification;image resolution;image texture;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;remote sensing;unsupervised learning","subdomain style compensation network;high spatial resolution imagery scene classification;urban planning;land cover classification;deeping learning;high classification accuracy;deep learning;training datasets;training data;domain migration;testing data;HSR remote Sensing cross-domain scene classification","","","","10","IEEE","28 Sep 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

On the other hand, video data contain both spatial and temporal information that must be simultaneously analyzed to solve action recognition problems. 3D CNNs are successfully used for these tasks, but they suffer from their extensive inherent parameter set. Increasing the network’s depth, as is common among 2D CNNs, and hence increasing the number of trainable parameters does not provide a good trade-off between accuracy and complexity of the 3D CNN. In this work, we propose Pooling Block (PB) as an enhanced pooling operation for optimizing action recognition by 3D CNNs. PB comprises three kernels of different sizes. The three kernels simultaneously sub-sample feature maps, and the outputs are concatenated into a single output vector.

The existing pansharpening methods, in general, have the problems of spectral distortion and lack of spatial detail information. To mitigate these problems, we propose a multiscale hybrid attention Transformer pansharpening network (MHATP-Net). In the proposed network, the shallow feature (SF) is first acquired through an SF extraction module (SFEM), which contains the convolutional block attention module (CBAM) and dynamic convolution blocks. The CBAM in this module can filter initial information roughly, and the dynamic convolution blocks can enrich the SF information. Then, the multiscale Transformer module is used to obtain multiencoding feature images. We propose a hybrid attention module (HAM) in the multiscale feature recovery module to effectively address the balance between the spectral feature retention and the spatial feature recovery. In the training process, we use deep semantic statistics matching (D2SM) loss to optimize the output model.

However, it is very challenging to extract roads around the thorny occlusion areas, even in high-resolution remote sensing images. Existing approaches regard road extraction as an isolated binary segmentation task and ignore the surroundings’ contextual information in the optical image itself, especially the potential dependence implied between roads and buildings. To address the occlusion problem, we proposed a spatial attention-based road extraction neural network using contextual relation between roads and buildings named MSACon to extract the roads more precisely. First, we employed an existing building extraction method to predict buildings in the optical images. Second, we calculated the signed distance map (SDM) based on the building extraction results (which may be inaccurate) as ambiguous auxiliary information to infer the optical images’ potential roads. Due to the color, lines, and texture between the optical images and the SDM are distinct, we then designed the two-branch encoder to extract features and integrated the cross-domain features into the road decoder by a spatial attention-based fusion mechanism. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior performance than other state-of-the-art approaches even with ambiguous auxiliary information. Furthermore, MSACon shows obvious advantages in finding inconspicuous roads in the optical images and eliminating noisy roads, especially when dealing with areas where buildings are located along the roads.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2021.3073923","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61806211,41971362,U19A2058); Natural Science Foundation of Hunan Province China(grant numbers:2020JJ4103); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9419675","Contextual information;road extraction;roads and buildings;signed distance map (SDM);spatial attention mechanism","Roads;Data mining;Buildings;Feature extraction;Optical imaging;Optical sensors;Image segmentation","data mining;deep learning (artificial intelligence);feature extraction;geophysical image processing;image colour analysis;image fusion;image resolution;image segmentation;image texture;optical images;remote sensing;roads","optical image;spatial attention-based road extraction neural network;MSACon;ambiguous auxiliary information;road decoder;spatial attention-based fusion mechanism;mining spatial attention-based contextual information;high-resolution remote sensing images;noisy roads;building extraction;deep learning;isolated binary segmentation;contextual relation;signed distance map;SDM;image color;image lines;image texture;two-branch encoder;feature extraction;cross-domain features","","11","","73","IEEE","29 Apr 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In the previous studies, the prediction of heart disease is done by applying the data mining methods. However, a limited number of research works are existed towards predicting cardiovascular disease. It is complex for choosing the perfect combination of significant features, which can enhance the prediction model performance. From data and ECG signals, the robust and automated detection of heart disease plays a major task for accurate and early medical diagnosis. This paper presents the viability analysis and the development of heart disease prediction using data mining as well as signal processing techniques. The proposed methodology adopts the optimized clustering approach by means of unique improvement in distance and density-based clustering. Here, K-Means clustering is used as the distance-based clustering and Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) is used as the density-based clustering. Initially, the prediction is focused on the data gathered from the standard clinical repository, in which the new weighted feature extraction is adopted. Once the informative features are extracted, it is subjected to hybrid clustering approach, in which the output of both clustering is considered for finding the final output. Here, the hybrid clustering is formed by merging the optimized K-means clustering and optimized DBCAN. In K-means clustering (KMC), the centroid is optimized, and in DBSCAN, value of $\varepsilon$ is optimized by the new variant of meta-heuristic algorithm called Modified Updating based Chicken Swarm optimization (MU-CSO). Similarly, the ECG signals is gathered, which is decomposed using Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT). Further, the dimension reduced features of the decomposed signals are extracted by Principal Component Analysis (PCA), to which the new weighted feature extraction is adopted. The main objective of optimized clustering is to maximize the prediction accuracy. Finally, the efficiency of the proposed heart disease prediction model is proved by comparing the proposed clustering over the conventional models.","","978-1-6654-0052-7","10.1109/ICAIS53314.2022.9742885","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9742885","Heart Disease Prediction;K-Means Clustering;Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise;Modified Updating-based Chicken Swarm Optimization","Heart;Clustering algorithms;Predictive models;Electrocardiography;Feature extraction;Prediction algorithms;Discrete wavelet transforms","data mining;discrete wavelet transforms;diseases;electrocardiography;feature extraction;medical signal processing;particle swarm optimisation;pattern clustering;principal component analysis","density-based clustering;cardiovascular disease;clinical data analysis;data mining;ECG signals;K-means clustering;distance-based clustering;density-based spatial clustering;weighted feature extraction;hybrid clustering;heart disease prediction;medical diagnosis;metaheuristic algorithm;modified updating-based chicken swarm optimization;discrete wavelet transform;principal component analysis;clinical repository","","1","","39","IEEE","30 Mar 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

First, most of the existing methods usually mine the pseudoground-truth (PGT) instances solely relying on proposal class scores (PCSs). Actually, the reliability of PCS is not enough because of the bird’s eye view imaging and large-scale chaotic background of RSIs, and the instances with high PCS incline to cover the discriminative region, rather than the whole object. Second, the existing methods assign a one-hot label to each instance, and the label of the PGT instance is copied to its neighbor instances, which induces the misclassification problem to some extent. Actually, the probability that the neighbor instances contain the object with the same category is smaller than the PGT instance. For the first problem, the proposal quality score (PQS) is proposed for mining high-quality PGT instances, which contain PCS and dual-context projection score (DCPS). The DCPS is calculated through semantic segmentation and is employed to measure the completeness that each proposal covers an object. For the second problem, a pseudosoft label assignment (PSLA) strategy is proposed to assign a more precise soft label for each instance, where the soft label is determined by the spatial distance between each instance and its nearest PGT instance. The ablation study validates the effectiveness of the PQS and PSLA.

To this end, traditional methods operate at the action level and rely on complicated strategies to prepare triplet samples, which only mines the cross-video relationships among three videos from two categories. In this work, we observe that action instances from different categories could exhibit similar motion patterns, i.e. subaction, and propose to operate at the sub-action granularity to elaborately explore cross-video relationships. However, only given video-level category labels, the sub-actions are undefined and not annotated. To tackle this challenge, we represent video features via a group of sub-actions, i.e. the sub-action family. Specifically, the sub-action family contains multiple feature vectors, where each vector is in charge of representing a specific sub-action. The sub-action family is shared among all videos in the dataset, while all videos contribute to the learning of the sub-action family. Consequently, we can not only get rid of the complicated sampling strategy but also thoroughly mine cross-video relationships from all available videos in the dataset. To learn feature vectors within the sub-action family, we employ a bottom-up temporal action localization paradigm and introduce an extra top-down branch. The sub-action family is introduced into the top-down branch, and it learns feature vectors via representing raw video features.

In this article, we leverage UAVs as the aerial fog nodes to provide computational resources to the IoMT devices. We aim to minimize the number of UAVs for covering the IoMT devices on the ground. This problem is modeled as a discrete nonlinear combinatory optimization problem with NP-hardness. A particle swarm optimization (PSO)-based strategy is put forward to solve this problem. In particular, we introduce greedy heuristic to speed up the searching process. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithms GASM_a and GASM_b can achieve better performance compared to the greedy and random approaches in terms of optimal values. In addition, the enhanced algorithm GASM_b can obtain the better result than GASM_a. Meanwhile, the execution time is also averagely increased by 16.51% compared to GASM_a.

In recent years, CD tasks have made many attempts in pure convolutional networks, attention mechanism, and transformer, and have achieved good results. Based on the power of attention and transformers, we hope to find a method that can handle the details of the image better and has better generalization ability. In this article, we propose a dual-feature mixed attention-based transformer network (DMATNet). First, we adopt a dual-feature extraction method, using a simple convolutional neural network (CNN) to extract coarse features, and a CNN based on progressive sampling to extract fine features. Then, we fuse the fine and coarse features with dual-feature mixed attention (DFMA) module. It can not only extract more specific regions of interest, but also overcome the misjudgment caused by oversampling, and synchronize feature extraction and target information integration. Finally, we use transformer to optimize these extracted information and feedback into the original features in the encoder to help remodel the pixel space. We merged the DMAT network into a deep feature difference-based CD framework and conducted extensive experiments on four datasets, LEVIR-CD, DSIFN-CD, WHU-CD, and CLCD, respectively, with tested F1 and interconnection over union (IoU) results of 90.75%/84.13%, 71.23%/55.32%, 85.70%/74.98%, and 66.56%/59.87%.

While previous studies have focused on step-by-step instructions, all-at-once teaching allows users to teach the behavior more naturally. However, all-at-once teaching needs to bridge the gap between verbal instruction and robot execution in order to understand which instruction corresponds to which demonstration section. To this end, we introduce the notion of task cohesion, which connects verbal instructions to robot execution based on the concept of physical/semantic state transition. We solve the problem of grounding and over/under-segmentation of language and demonstration by considering the cost of recursive dynamic programming, which divides the demonstration and grounds it to the language. The what-to-do can be obtained from the language, and the how-to-do can be obtained by extracting the parameters necessary for the execution of the robot based on the information of the task cohesion from the demonstration segments where the language is grounded. The contributions of this study are as follows: (1) to introduce task cohesion, (2) to propose a recursive dynamic programming approach to align verbal instructions and human demonstration, and (3) to demonstrate the effectiveness of multi-modal all-at-once teaching by integrating them.","2474-2325","978-1-6654-4540-5","10.1109/SII52469.2022.9708836","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9708836","","Costs;Grounding;Education;System integration;Robot sensing systems;Dynamic programming;Data mining","computer aided instruction;dynamic programming;image segmentation;learning (artificial intelligence);mobile robots;natural language processing;path planning;robot programming;robot vision;teaching","human demonstration;multimodal Learning-from-Observation;task cohesion;Multimodal Learning-from-Observation;promising robot teaching solution;teaching sequential operations;step-by-step instructions;verbal instruction;robot execution;instruction corresponds;demonstration section;demonstration segments;recursive dynamic programming approach;align verbal instructions","","1","","31","IEEE","16 Feb 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, the data in such systems suffer from various challenges such as security, reliability, and convenience, to name a few. Traditional systems are not useful to meet these critical issues because these systems have not a consistent structure for data security and reliability policies. Therefore, a new solution is required to enhance data accessibility and should regulate government security policies to ensure the accountability of the usage of the medical records system. Moreover, it is also required to analyze historical data of veterinary clinic using data mining and machine learning techniques to predict the future appointments scheduling requests, which is essential for veterinary management to drive better future decisions, for instance, future demands of medical supplies and to plan veterinary medical staff, etc. This paper aims to fill the gap by proposing a novel blockchain-based reliable and intelligent veterinary information management system (RIVIMS) using smart contract and machine learning techniques. The proposed RIVIMS consists of two main modules; blockchain-based secured veterinary information management, data and predictive analytics modules. First, a blockchain-based secure and reliable veterinary clinic information management system is developed using Hyperledger Fabric. Second, a smart contract enabled data, and predictive analytics modules are developed using permissioned blockchain framework. The data and predictive modules aim to analyze veterinary clinic patients appointments data in order to discover underlying patterns and build a robust prediction model using machine learning algorithms. The data and predictive helps veterinary management to drive better future business decisions to provide better healthcare services to veterinary patients. Hyperledger Caliper is used as a benchmark tool to evaluate the performance of the developed blockchain-based system in terms of transaction per second, transaction success rate, transaction throughput, and transaction latency. Furthermore, machine learning performance measures have utilized, such as MAE, RMSE, and R2 score to evaluate the overall performance of the prediction model.

Then, the Rapid Probabilistic Correlated Optimization (RPCO) mechanism is employed to select the optimal features by computing the matching score and likelihood of particles. Finally, the Block Correlated Neural Network (BCNN) technique is employed to classify the predicted label, where the relevancy score is computed by using the kernel function with the feature points.

In this paper, we propose and develop a novel worker recruitment game in socially aware MCS, i.e., Acceptance-aware Worker Recruitment (AWR). To accommodate MCS task invitation diffusion over social networks, we design a Random Diffusion model, where workers randomly propagate task invitations to social neighbors, and receivers independently make a decision whether to accept or not. Based on the diffusion model, we formulate the AWR game as a combinatorial optimization problem, which strives to search a subset of seed workers to maximize overall task acceptance under a pre-given incentive budget. We prove its NP hardness, and devise a meta-heuristic-based evolutionary approach named MA-RAWR to balance exploration and exploitation during the search process. Comprehensive experiments using two real-world data sets clearly validate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed approach.","1558-0660","","10.1109/TMC.2021.3090764","National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2018YFB2100800); National Natural Science Foundation for Distinguished Young Scholars(grant numbers:61725205); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:U2001207,61972319,61772428); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(grant numbers:31020180QD139); Universidade de Macau(grant numbers:SRG2021-00002-IOTSC); FDCT Macau SAR(grant numbers:SKL-IOTSC-2021-2023); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9462443","Mobile crowdsourcing;worker recruitment;social networks;memetic algorithm","Task analysis;Recruitment;Estimation;Social networking (online);Mobile computing;Memetics;Games","computational complexity;evolutionary computation;mobile computing;optimisation;social networking (online)","acceptance-aware mobile crowdsourcing worker recruitment;AWR game;complementary worker recruitment mode;increasing prominence;innovative distributed computing paradigm;location-dependent tasks;MA-RAWR;MCS task invitation diffusion;meta-heuristic-based evolutionary approach;NP hardness;online social networks;Random Diffusion model;seed workers;skilled workers;smart mobile devices;social neighbors;social relationships;task acceptance;task execution quality;task invitations;worker pool;worker recruitment game;worker recruitment mode","","2","","43","IEEE","22 Jun 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Also, for high-speed data streams, prior art cannot achieve high accuracy when the memory is tight. In this paper, we define a new issue, named finding significant items, and propose a novel algorithm namely LTC to address this issue. It includes two key techniques, Long-tail Restoring and CLOCK, as well as three optimizations. In addition, LTC is extended to support finding significant items with thresholds. We theoretically derive the correct rate and error bound, and conduct extensive experiments on three real datasets to test the performance of LTC. Our experimental results show that LTC can achieve $10^5$105 times higher accuracy in terms of average relative error than other related algorithms.

Most existing methods are trained in a fully-supervised or a weakly-supervised manner, which requires a time-consuming and expensive manually labeling process. In this work, we propose an alternative approach to achieving video moment retrieval that requires no textual annotations of videos and instead leverages the existing visual concept detectors and a pre-trained image-sentence embedding space. Specifically, we design a video-conditioned sentence generator to produce a suitable sentence representation by utilizing the mined visual concepts in videos. We then design a GNN-based relation-aware moment localizer to reasonably select a portion of video clips under the guidance of the generated sentence. Finally, the pre-trained image-sentence embedding space is adopted to evaluate the matching scores between the generated sentence and moment representations with the knowledge transferred from the image domain. By maximizing these scores, the sentence generator and moment localizer can enhance and complement each other to achieve the moment retrieval task.

Currently, Bahrain's Education and Training Quality Authority (BQA) is tasked with evaluating educational institutions' infrastructure and technology availability's impact on learning outcomes, overlooking factors such as family lifestyle, students' time allocation, health, and COVID-19 related factors. This study aims to identify trends that influence Bahraini private high school students' learning outcomes and measure the extent these factors impact to raise actionable recommendations. Specifically, this research implements Decision Tree (DT), Density-Based Clustering (DBC) and Linear Regression (LR) to identify such trends. In this context, learning outcomes are identified as average grades, which serve as an indicator of the knowledge retained. This study's results found that family life; parents' educational level in particular, has the most influential impact on student grades, while for time allocation, students must pay attention to their time management skills to ensure a balance trade-off between recreational activities and studying; not over allocate time to a specific activity.

Novel technologies in automated machine learning (AutoML) ease algorithm selection and hyperparameter optimization complexity. AutoML frame-works have achieved notable success in hyperparameter tuning and surpassed the performance of human experts. However, depending on such frameworks as black-box can leave machine learning practitioners without insights into the inner working of the AutoML process and hence influence their trust in the models produced. In addition, excluding humans from the loop creates several limitations. For example, most of the current AutoML frameworks ignore the user preferences on defining or controlling the search space, which consequently can impact the performance of the models produced and the acceptance of these models by the end-users. The research in the area of transparency and controllability of AutoML has attracted much interest lately, both in academia and industry. However, existing tools are usually restricted to supervised learning tasks such as classification and regression, while unsupervised learning, particularly clustering, remains a largely unexplored problem. Motivated by these shortcomings, we design and implement cSmartML-GlassBox, an interactive visualization tool that en-ables users to refine the search space of AutoML and analyze the results. cSmartML-GlassBox is equipped with a recommendation engine to recommend a time budget that is likely adequate for a new dataset to obtain well-performing pipeline. In addition, the tool supports multi-granularity visualization to enable machine learning practitioners to monitor the AutoML process, analyze the explored configurations and refine/control the search space. Furthermore, cSmartML-GlassBox is equipped with a logging mechanism such that repeated runs on the same dataset can be more effective by avoiding evaluating the same previously considered configurations. We demonstrate the effectiveness and usability of the cSmartML-GlassBox through a user evaluation study with 23 participants and an expert-based usability study based on four experts. We find that the proposed tool increases users' understanding and trust in the AutoML frameworks.","2375-9259","979-8-3503-4609-1","10.1109/ICDMW58026.2022.00015","European Regional Development Funds(grant numbers:MOBTT75); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10031201","clustering;meta-learning;hyperparameter optimization","Visualization;Machine learning algorithms;Machine learning;Aerospace electronics;Controllability;Usability;Optimization","data visualisation;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;pattern clustering;public domain software;regression analysis;supervised learning;system monitoring;unsupervised learning","automated clustering;AutoML frame-works;AutoML process;controllability;cSmartML-GlassBox;current AutoML frameworks;en-ables users;human experts;hyperparameter optimization complexity;hyperparameter tuning;inner working;interactive visualization tool;machine learning algorithms;machine learning practitioners;search space;supervised learning tasks;transparency;unsupervised learning;user evaluation study;user preferences","","","","56","IEEE","8 Feb 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This may lead to pitfalls in terms of security or single point of failure. Distributed ledger technology, specifically blockchain, is currently employed by different applications related to the Internet of Things (IoT) and 5G to address the drawbacks of centralized systems. For this reason, mobile blockchain networks (MBNs) have recently attracted a great deal of attention. To add a transaction to the blockchain in MBNs, mobile or IoT users must perform various tasks like encryption, decryption, and mining. These tasks require energy and processing power, which impose limitations on mobile and IoT users' performance because they are usually battery powered and have a low processing power. One possible solution is to perform the tasks virtually on commodity servers provided by mobile edge computing (MEC) or cloud computing. To do so, all tasks needed to add a transaction to the blockchain can be treated as virtual blockchain functions that can be executed on commodity servers. We introduce a blockchain virtualization framework called blockchain function virtualization (BFV), through which all blockchain functions can be performed virtually by MEC or cloud computing. Furthermore, we describe applications of the BFV framework and resource allocation challenges brought by the BFV framework in mobile networks. In addition, to illustrate the advantages of BFV, we define an optimization problem to simultaneously minimize the energy consumption cost and maximize miners' rewards. Finally, simulation results show the performance of the proposed framework in terms of total energy consumption, transaction confirmation rate, and miners' average profit.","1558-156X","","10.1109/MNET.009.2100473","University of Oulu; Academy of Finland(grant numbers:Profi6 336449,CHIST-ERA-17-BDSI-003/n.326270); Jane and Aatos Erkko Foundation; University of British Columbia; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9846939","","Blockchains;Internet of Things;Broadcasting;5G mobile communication;Servers;Task analysis;Computational modeling","5G mobile communication;blockchains;cloud computing;data privacy;distributed processing;energy consumption;Internet of Things;mobile computing;optimisation;power aware computing;resource allocation;virtualisation","beyond 5G mobile networks;BFV framework;blockchain function virtualization;centralized authority;centralized systems;cloud computing;commodity servers;distributed ledger technology;energy consumption cost;fifth-generation mobile networks;Internet of Things;IoT;MEC;miner average profit;mobile blockchain networks;mobile edge computing;network slicing;processing power;transaction confirmation rate","","1","","15","IEEE","1 Aug 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

In support of the hybrid transaction, blockchain oracle is an indispensable middleware responsible for receiving data-request tasks and pushing the result back to chain. Though solutions supporting hybrid transactions do exist, they are less featured or applicable for both contract and application developers. On one hand, the racing-condition among several concurrent hybrid transactions should be manually resolved by contract developers. On the other hand, application developers have to associate each individual task with its parent hybrid transaction in order to obtain the result. In this paper, a novel block-chain oracle platform with a set of simple but unified API for both hybrid and traditional transactions is proposed. Firstly, we design and implement a transactional storage layer and a transaction scheduler for transaction preservation and ordering. Secondly, with the help of an automatic result tracing mechanism, application developers are able to acquire transaction results transparently without awareness of oracles and underlying task execution. Experiments are conducted on one of current prevalent permissioned blockchain platforms, RepChain, and the result shows that all of the system design goals are fulfilled with merely an acceptable loss of performance.","","978-1-6654-6910-4","10.1109/CNIOT55862.2022.00010","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9814760","Distributed blockchain oracle;Hybrid Smart Contract","Smart contracts;Blockchains;Internet of Things;Task analysis;Middleware","application program interfaces;blockchains;contracts;data mining;scheduling;transaction processing","transactional storage layer;transaction scheduler;transaction preservation;application developers;transaction results;underlying task execution;current prevalent permissioned blockchain platforms;transparent distributed oracle;hybrid smart contracts;application domain;off-chain data access;blockchain oracle;data-request tasks;concurrent hybrid transactions;contract developers;parent hybrid transaction;novel block-chain oracle platform;TransOra;transaction-preserving distributed oracle","","","","19","IEEE","7 Jul 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The lack of flexible and accurate performance models, however, render this a challenging task. This article fills this gap by presenting accurate performance prediction models based on Stochastic Activity Networks (SANs). In contrast to existing work, the presented models consider multiple work queues, a critical feature to achieve high accuracy in realistic usage scenarios. We first introduce a monolithic analytical model for a multi-queue YARN cluster running DAG-based Big Data applications that models each queue individually. To overcome the limited scalability of the monolithic model, we then present a fixed-point model that iteratively computes the throughput of a single queue with respect to the rest of the system until a fixed-point is reached. The models are evaluated on a real-world cluster running the widely-used Apache Spark framework and the YARN scheduler. Experiments with the common transaction-based TPC-DS benchmark show that the proposed models achieve an average error of only $5.6\%$5.6% in predicting the execution time of the Spark jobs. The presented models enable businesses to optimize their cluster configuration for a given workload and thus to reduce their expenses and minimize service level agreement (SLA) violations.

To solve these problems, not only heart sound analysis based on handcrafted features, but also computer-aided heart sound analysis based on deep learning have been extensively studied in recent years. Though with elaborate design, most of these methods still use additional pre-processing to improve classification performance, which heavily relies on time-consuming experienced engineering. In this paper, we propose a parameter-efficient densely connected dual attention network (DDA) for heart sound classification. It combines two advantages simultaneously of the purely end-to-end architecture and enriched contextual representations of the self-attention mechanism. Specifically, the densely connected structure can automatically extract the information flow of heart sound features hierarchically. Alongside, improving contextual modeling capabilities, the dual attention mechanism adaptively aggregates local features with global dependencies via a self-attention mechanism, which captures the semantic interdependencies across position and channel axes respectively. Extensive experiments across stratified 10-fold cross-validation strongly evidence that our proposed DDA model surpasses current 1D deep models on the challenging Cinc2016 benchmark with significant computational efficiency.","2168-2208","","10.1109/JBHI.2023.3286585","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:11771435,22073110); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10153579","Cinc2016;dense block;dual attention;phonocardiogram","Feature extraction;Heart;Phonocardiography;Hidden Markov models;Data mining;Convolution;Task analysis","","","","","","","IEEE","15 Jun 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

Buses are an indispensable way of moving for urban residents with fixed routes and schedules, which leads to latent travel regularity. However, human mobility patterns, specifically the complex relationships between bus passengers, are deeply hidden in this fixed mobility mode. Although many models exist to predict traffic flow, human mobility patterns have not been well explored in this regard. To address this research gap and learn human mobility knowledge from this fixed travel behaviors, we propose a multi-pattern passenger flow prediction framework, MPGCN, based on Graph Convolutional Network (GCN). Firstly, we construct a novel sharing-stop network to model relationships between passengers based on bus record data. Then, we employ GCN to extract features from the graph by learning useful topology information and introduce a deep clustering method to recognize mobility patterns hidden in bus passengers. Furthermore, to fully utilize spatio-temporal information, we propose GCN2Flow to predict passenger flow based on various mobility patterns. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first work to adopt a multi-pattern approach to predict the bus passenger flow by taking advantage of graph learning. We design a case study for optimizing routes.

While image analysis can provide an important diagnostic basis for clinical treatment, image analysis also needs to determine its different analysis purposes (i.e., purpose preference for image analysis) according to different treatment requirements. Such purpose-preference image analysis will help improve the diagnostic capability of clinical care. In recent years, with the rapid development of deep learning for semantic segmentation, this technique has become an important auxiliary aid for medical image analysis. However, the expensive manual labeling cost makes the training data for semantic segmentation insufficient. This may lead to models that exhibit poor segmentation ability, while increasing the likelihood of models providing misleading information. To solve the problem of insufficient training data, many improvement methods have been proposed. For example, transfer learning, unsupervised learning, and semi-supervised learning. However, some of the methods have been poorly optimized on medical images. The semantic segmentation network UA-MT provides a semi-supervised approach based on the V-Net architecture to alleviate the data shortage problem, but it rarely integrates the segmentation performance with the purpose preference of image analysis. In this paper, we propose a semi-supervised learning network (U-SSLN) based on the U-Net architecture, which can be integrated with the purposeful preference of image analysis by different optimization combination strategies. U-SSLN integrates the advantages of UA-MT and U-Net architecture, and its combination strategies are mainly through residual concatenation (RC) on the segmentation model and batch normalization (BN) on the up-down sampling layer to implementation. These combined strategies can further optimize the segmentation performance of the segmentation network on different metrics, allowing the segmentation network to better assist in different stages of medical analysis. In order to verify the feasibility and effectiveness of U-SSLN, we conducted a large number of comparative experiments. The results of the experiments show that the segmentation models based on USSLN outperform the supervised segmentation models in all of them. Moreover, the U-SSLN without RC and BN achieves optimal performance (87.91% and 78.71%) on the area metrics Dice and Jaccard.

Since the update rule of RMS is closer to BMS, the convergence of point iterates is conjectured based on the Chen’s BMS convergence theorem. Experimental results on synthetic and real datasets show that RMS in several cases outperforms MS and BMS in the clustering task. In addition, RMS exhibits larger attraction basins than MS and BMS for identical parametrization; consequently, its kernel variant requires a lower aperture of the kernel function, and its NN variant a lower number of nearest neighbors compared to MS or BMS, to achieve optimal clustering results. In addition, the NN version of RMS does not need to specify a convergence threshold to stop the iterations, contrarily to the NN-BMS algorithm.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3147951","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9698033","Data mining;data clustering;mean-shift;kernel-based method;nearest neighbors","Convergence;Kernel;Bandwidth;Clustering algorithms;Task analysis;Standards;Sensitivity","Gaussian processes;iterative methods;nearest neighbour methods;optimisation;pattern clustering","MS;clustering task;RMS;kernel variant;nearest neighbors;optimal clustering results;NN-BMS algorithm;mean-shift algorithm;data clustering;update equation;nearest-neighbor-based fashion;update rule;Chen BMS convergence theorem;blurring mean-shift;standard mean-shift;robust mean-shift;NN variant","","8","","42","CCBY","31 Jan 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The lack of data hinders the development of novel materials. The figures and captions in the material literature cover essential information regarding the entire document and have sufficient image sample data for research. Accordingly, how to extract figures and captions from the literature is critical to solve the lack of data. Though some PDF parsing tools are capable of extracting information from documents, they generally identify a document's figures by parsing the document into a concrete structure. As impacted by the inconsistency of the form of different journals, they commonly achieve wrong recognition results. Thus, an efficient figure and caption extraction network FCENet is proposed in the present study. Inconsistent with other extraction tools, this study first attempts to adopt instance segmentation models to detect figures and their captions, and then extract them. FCENet developed in this study builds upon BlendMask and introduces a horizontal and vertical attention module. This study splits the BlendMask detection head into two branches, i.e., figure detection and caption detection, which increases final detection accuracy and speed. This study collects nearly 3000 material documents for model training and testing. As revealed from the last experiments and results, the performance of FCENet is significantly compared with that of other existing instance segmentation models. Its box and mask mAP (mean Average Precision) are 8.51% and 12.59% higher than those of BlendMask, respectively.

Over a period of 9 weeks, human forecasters who averaged +0.96% ROI as individuals amplified their ROI to +2.3% when predicting together in artificial swarms (p=0.128). Further, a $\$5,000$ bankroll was managed by investing in the top three buy recommendations produced each week by ASI, which yielded a 2.0% ROI over the course of the 9-week study.

However, due to their highly unstructured nature, graph algorithms remain extremely challenging for most parallel systems, with large gaps between observed performance and theoretical limits. Further-more, most mainstream architectures rely heavily on single instruction multiple data (SIMD) processing for high floating-point rates, which is not beneficial for graph processing which instead requires high memory bandwidth, low memory latency, and efficient processing of unstructured data. On the other hand, we are currently observing an explosion of new hardware architectures, many of which are adapted to specific purposes and diverge from traditional designs. A notable example is the Graphcore Intelligence Processing Unit (IPU), which is developed to meet the needs of upcoming machine intelligence applications. Its design eschews the traditional cache hierarchy, relying on SRAM as its main memory instead. The result is an extremely high-bandwidth, low-latency memory at the cost of capacity. In addition, the IPU consists of a large number of independent cores, allowing for true multiple instruction multiple data (MIMD) processing. Together, these features suggest that such a processor is well suited for graph processing. We test the limits of graph processing on multiple IPUs by implementing a low-level, high-performance code for breadth-first search (BFS), following the specifications of Graph500, the most widely used benchmark for parallel graph processing. Despite the simplicity of the BFS algorithm, implementing efficient parallel codes for it has proven to be a challenging task in the past. We show that our implementation scales well on a system with 8 IPUs and attains roughly twice the performance of an equal number of NVIDIA V100 GPUs using state-of-the-art CUDA code.","2640-0316","978-1-6654-1016-8","10.1109/HiPC53243.2021.00030","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9680436","BFS;IPU;Graph500;Performance Optimization","Codes;Machine learning algorithms;Scalability;Memory management;Graphics processing units;Random access memory;Benchmark testing","cache storage;graph theory;graphics processing units;multiprocessing systems;parallel algorithms;parallel architectures;SRAM chips;tree searching","parallel breadth-first;parallel graph algorithms;high-performance computing;numerical simulations;machine learning workloads;single instruction multiple data processing;unstructured data;Graphcore intelligence processing unit;machine intelligence applications;multiple instruction multiple data processing;high-performance code;parallel graph processing;BFS algorithm;parallel codes;iPUG;Graphcore IPU;SIMD;cache hierarchy;SRAM;MIMD;Graph500;NVIDIA V100 GPU;CUDA code","","1","","33","IEEE","24 Jan 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Due to the mobility of vehicles and the heterogeneity of communication interfaces, there are many challenges for data transmission and the processing of telematics. Therefore, network resources, roadside unit devices and sunken edge nodes need to work together to guarantee real-time network communication. Thus, they can jointly help improve the quality of network services and user experience and show the level of vehicle-road collaboration in terms of safety, efficiency and service. In view of future 5G network-related technologies and C-V2X development trends, this paper provides a comprehensive technical solution framework for telematics based on end-edge collaboration, and combines network resource deployment optimization and edge caching technologies for video transmission tasks in telematics application scenarios. By adding both a 5G base roadside unit (RSU) station and an UAV mobile base station, network resources are better allocated for scalable coded video, and a relatively better edge caching strategy is obtained based on user mobility analysis. Aiming to improve the network system performance, the vehicle side, roadside and edge side are jointly considered to improve the utilization efficiency of limited network resources.

Due to the dramatic domain gap between the ground and aerial images, the problem is challenging. The existing approaches mainly adopt convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to learn discriminative features. However, these CNN-based methods mainly leverage appearance and semantic information but fail to jointly model the appearance, positional, and orientation properties of scene objects, which belong to the spatial hierarchy. Since spatial hierarchy information is crucial for cross-view feature correspondence, in this article, we propose an end-to-end network architecture, dubbed GeoNet. GeoNet consists of a ResNetX module and a GeoCaps module. On the one hand, the ResNetX module is developed to learn powerful intermediate feature maps and allows the stable propagation of gradients in deep CNNs. On the other hand, the GeoCaps module utilizes the capsule network to encapsulate the intermediate feature maps into several capsules, whose length and orientation represent the existence probability and spatial hierarchy information of scene objects, respectively. Moreover, by using a dynamic routing-by-agreement mechanism, the GeoCaps module is capable of modeling parts-to-whole relationships between scene objects, which is viewpoint invariant and capable of bridging the cross-view domain gap. In addition to GeoNet, we introduce a simple yet effective metric learning method, based on which two weighted soft margin loss functions with online batch hard sample mining are devised. These functions not only speed up convergence but also improve the generalization ability of the network. Extensive experiments on three well-known datasets demonstrate that our GeoNet not only achieves state-of-the-art results for the ground-to-aerial and aerial-to-ground geo-localization tasks but also outperforms competing approaches for the few-shot geo-localization task.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2021.3121337","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62072318,41971300); Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province of China(grant numbers:2021A1515012014); Fundamental Research Project in the Science and Technology Plan of Shenzhen(grant numbers:JCYJ20190808172007500); Key Project of Department of Education of Guangdong Province(grant numbers:2020ZDZX3045); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9579411","Batch hard-mining;capsule network;cross-view image matching;image geo-localization","Task analysis;Global Positioning System;Semantics;Location awareness;Network architecture;Visualization;Satellites","convolutional neural nets;deep learning (artificial intelligence);feature extraction;geography;geophysical image processing;image classification;image matching;object recognition","aerial-to-ground geo-localization tasks;few-shot geo-localization task;geographic semantic network;geo-location;query ground-view image;aerial images;convolutional neural networks;scene objects;end-to-end network architecture;GeoNet;ResNetX module;GeoCaps module;capsule network;cross-view image geo-localization;ground-to-aerial localization task;global positioning system;GPS;CNN;dynamic routing-by-agreement mechanism","","3","","48","IEEE","18 Oct 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Automated data analysis methods are warranted but a non-trivial obstacle is given by the very large dimensionality of the data. A flow field typically consists of six measurement values for each point of the computational grid in 3D space and time (velocity vector values, turbulent kinetic energy, pressure and viscosity). In this paper we address the task of extracting meaningful results in an automated manner from such high dimensional data sets. We propose deep learning methods which are capable of processing such data and which can be trained to solve relevant tasks on simulation data, i.e. predicting drag and lift forces applied on an airfoil. We also propose an adaptation of the classical hand crafted features known from computer vision to address the same problem and compare a large variety of descriptors and detectors. Finally, we compile a large dataset of 2D simulations of the flow field around airfoils which contains 16000 flow fields with which we tested and compared approaches.

Style feature is a set of correlation matrix based on style image, namely Gram matrix. Each matrix is a global description of the style image. This kind of methods can perform well in the insensitive semantic scenes (such as the style transfer between landscape photos), but in the sensitive semantic scenes (such as the style transfer between portrait photos), the problem of semantic mismatch will be highlighted, such as transferring the background texture of the style image to the foreground of the target image. Although the existing research takes the manually annotated semantic image as an input of the algorithm, and then guides the style transfer based on the semantic information, and finally achieves good results in the style transfer between portraits. But there are still two problems: first, semantic images need to be manually annotated, which costs human resources. In practical applications, large-scale image style transfer is often needed. Second, the details of the synthesized image are fuzzy, and the definition is not enough. We propose an image style transfer algorithm based on semantic segmentation to resolve semantic mismatching in image style transfer. Our algorithm extracts the semantic information of style image and content image automatically through a semantic segmentation network and uses the semantic information to guide the style transfer. Our algorithm builds a semantic segmentation network based on mask R-CNN, introduces semantic information, and then makes style transfer on the patch level, realizes the style transfer between similar objects (consistent semantic information). Experiments on Celeba and Wikiart show that our method could automatically extract the semantic information of style image and content image. Compared with the state-of-art approaches in this field, our method can effectively avoid semantic mismatch in the process of image style transfer.

The deployment of the Network in Boxes (NIB) supporting B5G/6G network in the vehicle can realize the real-time communication with the edge server (ES) and offload the task to the ES. However, the current Multi-access Edge Computing (MEC) lacks research on cooperative processing among multiple edge servers (ESs), and the efficiency of data-intensive computation tasks is still insufficient. In this paper, we investigate the cooperative offloading of multi-type tasks among ESs in B5G/6G networks under dynamic environment. In order to minimize the delay of task execution, we regard cooperative offloading as a Markov Decision Process (MDP), and improve the convergence speed and stability of traditional SAC(Soft Actor Critic) algorithm by adaptive weight sampling mechanism. Finally, an offline centralized training distributed execution framework based on improved soft actor critical (ISAC)(OCTDE-ISAC)is proposed to optimize the cooperative offloading strategy.

The challenges of the task are to deeply understand the story context, mine the storylines hidden in the story, and generate rational endings in logic and sentiment. Although existing pre-trained approaches have been proven effective to this task, how to learn to generate endings with appropriate plots and sufficient sentimental information still remains a major challenge. One possible reason is that an over reliance on external commonsense knowledge beyond the storylines and sentimental trends information hidden in the story context could lead to generation deviating from the main theme. To address this issue, we propose a two-stage Stroylines and Sentiment Aware Pre-trained model (SSAP) for generating sentimentally relevant story endings. We apply a classifier for discriminating the sentiment of the story, and then employ a pre-trained language model, combining with storylines information, to conditionally generate sentences that match both the logic and sentiment of the story. Automatic and manual evaluations show that, without integrating external knowledge, our model can produce more consistent and diverse story endings than state-of-the-art baselines.","2329-9304","","10.1109/TASLP.2022.3145320","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62076100,62171145); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(grant numbers:D2210010,D2200150,D2201300); Science and Technology Planning Project of Guangdong Province(grant numbers:2020B0101100002); Open Foundation of the Key Laboratory of Big Data and Intelligent Robot; South China University of Technology; Ministry of Education; Guangxi Major Projects of Science and Technology(grant numbers:2020AA21077007); Hong Kong Research Grants Council(grant numbers:PolyU1121417,PolyU 11204919,C1031-18 G); Internal Research Grant from Hong Kong Polytechnic University(grant numbers:1.9B0V,P0036846); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9693209","Story ending generation;pre-trained language model;storylines;sentiment conditional generation","Context modeling;Task analysis;Market research;Commonsense reasoning;Motion pictures;Transformers;Speech processing","information retrieval;learning (artificial intelligence);natural language processing;pattern classification;text analysis","story ending generation;appropriate ending;incomplete story;story context;rational endings;pre-trained approaches;generate endings;sufficient sentimental information;sentimental trends information;generation deviating;Sentiment Aware Pre-trained model;sentimentally relevant story endings;pre-trained language model;storylines information;consistent story endings;diverse story endings;under-explored task","","","","41","IEEE","25 Jan 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The main one is “Transport strategy of the Russian Federation for the period up to 2030”. The document reflects the systemic problems of the operation of land passenger transport, one of which is the discrepancy between the qualitative and quantitative indicators of services provided by land urban passenger transport (NGPT), the actual requirements for ensuring the transport mobility of the population (TPM). All over the world, there is a tendency to introduce innovative technologies in the field of monitoring systems and centralized management of NGPT : hardware and software, communications, positioning, etc. The development of passenger transport management technologies in all developed and densely populated countries is moving towards the widespread use of modern infocommunication telematictechnologies, intelligent algorithms and devices installed on vehicles and roads. There is a clear tendency to an ever-increasing increase in the parameters of the state of objects of the passenger transport system assessed in the process of monitoring, an increase in the amount of processed information in peripheral devices installed on a vehicle or road, automatic distribution of the received information between the dispatcher, driver, passengers, automatic traffic control systems and others. participants in the management process. In practice, a new industry has emerged – intelligent passenger transport control systems integrated into the general traffic control system for all types of vehicles. Methods for the formation of the route network of NGPT should be based on decision-making models in information situations, characterized as situations with an uncertain state of the research environment. In this case, in order to identify objective data on the capacity of passenger traffic, it is necessary to use modern digital resources, which make it possible to produce “on-line” Monitoring of fuel supply, and the only possible way for the effective development of oil and gas fuel in the Russian Federation is the formation of a new industry-intelligent control systems for oil and gas, integrated into digital transport ecosystems (CTES). Therefore, the development of tools for solving control problems in the CHPP : new methods, mathematical models, algorithms, practical techniques based on them, is an important national economic task, and its solution is impossible without special scientific research.","","978-1-6654-0075-6","10.1109/TIRVED53476.2021.9639129","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9639129","digital technologies;transport technologies;transport mobility;urban transport development;passenger traffic management;online monitoring of passenger traffic","Economics;Schedules;Roads;Ecosystems;Sociology;Process control;Traffic control","control engineering computing;decision making;intelligent control;road traffic control;road vehicles;town and country planning;transportation","digital transportation technologies;bus routes;Russian Federation;bus transportation;regulatory documents;regional governments;systemic problems;land passenger transport;land urban passenger transport;NGPT;transport mobility;innovative technologies;centralized management;passenger transport management technologies;developed countries;densely populated countries;passenger transport system;processed information;automatic distribution;automatic traffic control systems;management process;intelligent passenger transport control systems;general traffic control system;passenger traffic;modern digital resources;industry-intelligent control systems;digital transport ecosystems","","1","","20","IEEE","14 Dec 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Due to the exponential number of possible label sets to be considered by the predictive model, it is commonly assumed that label correlations should be well exploited to design an effective multi-label learning approach. On the other hand, class-imbalance stands as an intrinsic property of multi-label data which significantly affects the generalization performance of the multi-label predictive model. For each class label, the number of training examples with positive labeling assignment is generally much less than those with negative labeling assignment. To deal with the class-imbalance issue for multi-label learning, a simple yet effective class-imbalance aware learning strategy called cross-coupling aggregation (COCOA) is proposed in this article. Specifically, COCOA works by leveraging the exploitation of label correlations as well as the exploration of class-imbalance simultaneously. For each class label, a number of multiclass imbalance learners are induced by randomly coupling with other labels, whose predictions on the unseen instance are aggregated to determine the corresponding labeling relevancy. Extensive experiments on 18 benchmark datasets clearly validate the effectiveness of COCOA against state-of-the-art multi-label learning approaches especially in terms of imbalance-specific evaluation metrics.","2168-2275","","10.1109/TCYB.2020.3027509","National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2018YFB1004300); National Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61573104); China University S&T Innovation Plan Guided by the Ministry of Education; Collaborative Innovation Center of Novel Software Technology and Industrialization; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9262911","Class-imbalance;cross-coupling aggregation (COCOA);machine learning;multi-label learning","Training;Correlation;Predictive models;Labeling;Task analysis;Couplings;Technological innovation","learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification","multiple class labels;label correlations;multilabel data;multilabel predictive model;class label;positive labeling assignment;negative labeling assignment;imbalance-specific evaluation metrics;class-imbalance aware multilabel learning;cross-coupling aggregation","","14","","69","IEEE","18 Nov 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Collaborative filtering is the most simple and efficient recommender system approach, as it makes use of the similarity among users’ preferences to generate recommendations. However, this approach suffers from some issues such as data sparsity and scalability, which make the process of identifying user’s neighbourhood a challenging task. This paper proposes a clustering-based collaborative filtering recommender system using the k-means algorithm along with a nature-inspired algorithm to improve the clustering process, which leads to a better recommendation quality. The Artificial Fish Swarm Algorithm (AFSA) has been employed to determine the optimal initial centroid for the clustering task. MovieLens 100K dataset was used to evaluate the proposed system’s performance in terms of precision, recall, and mean absolute error. The dataset was divided into 80% and 20% randomly for training and testing, respectively. Python 3.9.12 programming languages was used to implement the proposed system. The experimental results confirmed over the different number of clusters and the value of mean absolute error decreased from 0.75 to 0.67 as the number of clusters increased from 5 to 35 clusters. The obtained results are compared against other recent nature-inspired algorithms, which proved that the proposed recommender system outperforms the considered methods.","","978-1-6654-7220-3","10.1109/IICCIT55816.2022.10010649","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10010649","Recommender system;Collaborative filtering;Clustering;K-means;AFSA;Optimization algorithm","Training;Collaborative filtering;Scalability;Clustering algorithms;Information filters;Information and communication technology;Task analysis","collaborative filtering;optimisation;pattern clustering;recommender systems","artificial fish swarm algorithm;clustering process;clustering task;clustering-based collaborative filtering recommender system;collaborative recommender system;data sparsity;filtering technique;mean absolute error;nature-inspired algorithm;nature-inspired algorithms;recommendation quality;recommender system approach","","","","21","IEEE","13 Jan 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A trust evaluation method for service composition in cloud manufacturing is proposed in this article. To quantitatively calculate the trust, a trust evaluation index system is established that comprehensively considers the influencing factors in the production, transaction, and collaboration processes of cloud manufacturing services. The trust value is synthesized based on all index values using the criteria importance through intercriteria correlation method. To extract the temporal information in historical trust data, a time-aware predictive trust evaluation method based on gated recurrent unit is proposed to learn the changing pattern of trust value over time. The trust data are trained together with their timestamps to predict the trust in the scheduled transaction time. The correlation between services in service composition is modeled to mine the correlation information by association analysis. The trust of service composition depends on the trust values of all component services and the correlations between them.

In this work, we propose $\mathsf {Hydra}$Hydra, a multi-task deep learning based recommendation system that offers multi-modal transportation planning and is adaptive to various situational context (e.g., nearby point-of-interest (POI) distribution and weather). We leverage the availability of existing routing engines and big urban data, and design a novel two-level framework that integrates uni-modal and multi-modal (e.g., taxi-bus, bus-cycle) routes as well as heterogeneous urban data for intelligent multi-modal transportation recommendation. In addition to urban context features constructed from multi-source urban data, we learn the latent representations of users, origin-destination (OD) pairs and transportation modes based on user implicit feedbacks, which captures the collaborative transportation mode preferences of users and OD pairs. Moreover, we propose two models to recommend the proper route among various uni-modal and multi-modal transportation routes: (1) a light-weight gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT) based recommendation model; and (2) a multi-task wide and deep learning (MTWDL) based recommendation model.

Exploiting deep learning and introducing compact WSI representations are urgently needed to accelerate image analysis and facilitate the visualization and interpretability of pathology results in a postpandemic world. In this article, we introduce a new evolutionary approach for WSI representation based on large-scale multiobjective optimization (LSMOP) of deep embeddings. We start with patch-based sampling to feed KimiaNet, a histopathology-specialized deep network, and to extract a multitude of feature vectors. Coarse multiobjective feature selection uses the reduced search space strategy guided by the classification accuracy and the number of features. In the second stage, the frequent features histogram (FFH), a novel WSI representation, is constructed by multiple runs of coarse LSMOP. Fine evolutionary feature selection is then applied to find a compact (short-length) feature vector based on the FFH and contributes to a more robust deep-learning approach to digital pathology supported by the stochastic power of evolutionary algorithms. We validate the proposed schemes using The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) images in terms of WSI representation, classification accuracy, and feature quality. Furthermore, a novel decision space for multicriteria decision making in the LSMOP field is introduced. Finally, a patch-level visualization approach is proposed to increase the interpretability of deep features.

We propose novel coded DC mechanisms with two different incentive distributions that consider the time-discounting value of processed results and the amount of the workload computed by MDs. Specifically, we consider distributed gradient descent computing with coding when a task publisher (TP) with a limited amount of budget offers incentives to encourage MDs' participation in the computation. To analyze a hierarchical decision-making structure of the TP and MDs, we formulate a strategic competition between them as a Stackelberg game. In the case that the MDs are the leaders, we design a CPU-cycle frequency control scheme to balance each MD's computing speed and energy consumption for obtaining its maximum utility with the incentive mechanisms. As the follower, the TP aims at minimizing latency of the DC, and it follows the MDs' decisions to determine the load allocation for each MD. Then, we design an algorithm achieving the Stackelberg equilibrium, which is shown to be a unique Nash equilibrium of the game. The performance evaluation results show that the proposed mechanisms achieve 39% of LR on average compared to the benchmark mechanism. Furthermore, the results corroborate the efficiency of the proposed mechanisms in terms of the MDs' social welfare.","2327-4662","","10.1109/JIOT.2020.3045277","Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF); Ministry of Education(grant numbers:2019R1A6A3A13097142); Institute of Information and Communications Technology Planning and Evaluation; Korea Government (MSIT, A Study on 5G Based Intelligent IoT Trust Enabler)(grant numbers:2020-0-00833); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9296286","Coded distributed computing (DC);incentive mechanism;load management;Stackelberg game","Distributed computing;Encoding;Task analysis;Internet of Things;Games;Resource management;Distributed databases","decision making;energy consumption;game theory;gradient methods;Internet of Things;mobile computing;power aware computing;resource allocation","performance evaluation;Nash equilibrium;Stackelberg equilibrium;load allocation;energy consumption;strategic competition;task publisher;distributed gradient descent computing;coded DC mechanisms;game theoretic approach;incentive-based coded distributed computing management;CPU-cycle frequency control;MD computing speed;MD social welfare;IoT services;incentive distributions;time-discounting value;Internet-of-Things services;heterogeneous mobile devices;computing mechanisms;latency reduction;incentive mechanisms;Stackelberg game;hierarchical decision-making structure","","8","","64","IEEE","16 Dec 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Deep neural networks have been successfully applied to NER tasks. However, they require a large number of annotated data. Regardless of the number of data made available, annotation requires significant human effort, which is expensive and time-consuming. Moreover, collecting labeled data that reflect contemporary surrounding statuses requires exhaustive follow-up and incurs correspondingly higher costs. Current NERs typically focus on the supervised learning of hand-crafted data. The most well-known dataset for NER shared tasks, which was released at the 2003 Conference on Natural Language Learning, is used for basic training and evaluation. Although the data are qualified, the database has low coverage of timely material. In this paper, we illustrate methods for swiftly labeling up-to-date data via distant supervision. To tackle the difficulty of annotating contemporary written texts, we generate labeled data articles that reflect the latest issues. We evaluated the proposed methods with bidirectional long short-term memory conditional random-field architecture using static and contextualized embedding methods. Our proposed models perform higher than state-of-the-art methods with average F1-scores 3.09% better with weakly labeled Wikipedia data and 3.47% better with Cable News Network data.

In recent years, nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) has received great attention in the HU due to its simultaneous estimation, flexible modeling, and little requirement on prior information. However, several common NMF algorithms still suffer from high computational complexity, instability, and low convergence rate. Motivated by the matrix manifold theory, this article proposes a new sparse oblique-manifold ( $\mathcal {OB}$ ) NMF method from the perspective of matrix manifold. The critical idea of the proposed method is to regard the abundance matrix as locating on the oblique manifold, which eliminates its constraint of nonnegativity and sum-to-one and incorporates its intrinsic Riemannian geometry. Meanwhile, the  $L_{1/2}$ -norm on the Euclidean space can be transformed equivalently into the  $L_{1}$ -norm on oblique manifold. Then, via solving this sparse  $\mathcal {OB}$ NMF by the Riemannian conjugated gradient (RCG) algorithm and the multiplicative iterative rule, the proposed method not only ensures improvement in the solution accuracy but also leads to a much faster convergence rate. Experimental results from the synthetic and real-world datasets illustrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method compared with the state-of-the-art NMF methods in HU.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2021.3082255","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61877021); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9444566","L₁/₂ regularization;hyperspectral unmixing (HU);nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF);oblique manifold","Manifolds;Sparse matrices;Hyperspectral imaging;Optimization;Convergence;Task analysis;Indexes","geometry;geophysical image processing;hyperspectral imaging;matrix decomposition","sparse oblique-manifold nonnegative matrix factorization;hyperspectral unmixing;hyperspectral image processing;flexible modeling;high computational complexity;convergence rate;matrix manifold theory;OB NMF;Riemannian conjugated gradient algorithm;RCG;multiplicative iterative rule","","","","58","IEEE","31 May 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, it can only be achieved at the expense of images’ spatial resolution. HSI super-resolution (HSI-SR), thus, addresses this problem by fusing low-resolution (LR) HSI with the multispectral image (MSI) carrying much higher spatial resolution (HR). Existing HSI-SR approaches require the LR HSI and HR MSI to be well registered, and the reconstruction accuracy of the HR HSI relies heavily on the registration accuracy of different modalities. In this article, we propose an unregistered and unsupervised mutual Dirichlet-Net ( $u^{2}$ -MDN) to exploit the uncharted problem domain of HSI-SR without the requirement of multimodality registration. The success of this endeavor would largely facilitate the deployment of HSI-SR since registration requirement is difficult to satisfy in real-world sensing devices. The novelty of this work is threefold. First, to stabilize the fusion procedure of two unregistered modalities, the network is designed to extract spatial information and spectral information of two modalities with different dimensions through a shared encoder–decoder structure. Second, the mutual information (MI) is further adopted to capture the nonlinear statistical dependencies between the representations from two modalities (carrying spatial information) and their raw inputs. By maximizing the MI, spatial correlations between different modalities can be well characterized to further reduce the spectral distortion. We assume that the representations follow a similar Dirichlet distribution for their inherent sum-to-one and nonnegative properties. Third, a collaborative  $l_{2,1}$ -norm is employed as the reconstruction error instead of the more common  $l_{2}$ -norm to better preserve the spectral information. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of  $u^{2}$ -MDN as compared to the state of the art.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2021.3079518","National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)(grant numbers:NNX12CB05C,NNX16CP38P); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9442804","Hyperspectral image (HSI);mutual information (MI);super-resolution (SR);unregistered;unsupervised deep learning","Spatial resolution;Image reconstruction;Data mining;Bayes methods;Superresolution;Tensors;Optimization","computer vision;geophysical image processing;hyperspectral imaging;image fusion;image reconstruction;image registration;image representation;image resolution;remote sensing;statistical analysis","registration requirement;mutual information;spatial correlations;computer vision;remote sensing tasks;HSI superresolution;low-resolution HSI;multispectral image;LR HSI;unregistered Dirichlet-Net;unsupervised mutual Dirichlet-Net;unregistered hyperspectral image superresolution;unsupervised hyperspectral image superresolution;image spatial resolution;MSI;HR HSI reconstruction accuracy;fusion procedure;shared encoder-decoder structure;nonlinear statistical dependencies;Dirichlet distribution;sum-to-one properties;collaborative l2,1-norm;u2-MDN","","15","","85","IEEE","27 May 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The agility of the parameters makes it difficult to describe MFR statistically, and traditional statistical description methods based on signal characteristics are difficult to support the needs of MFR recognition tasks. Another potential MFR description method is using the high-dimensional temporal pattern hidden in pulse stream, which is represented by the pulse repetition interval (PRI) switch rule and value range. This paper uses motif mining algorithm to find high-dimensional repeated patterns in MFR pulse stream, and the key PRI sequence of MFR is obtained through further screening. Then, multiple key sample sequence matchers are integrated into a matching degree generator, which is used to output the matching degree between the MFR to be identified and the reference MFR.

Although most existing works have captured the opinion target using Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), they cannot effectively utilize the local context, i.e. relationship among surrounding words of opinion words. In this work, we propose a novel and powerful model for TOWE, Gated Relational target-aware Encoder and local context-aware Decoder (GRED), which dynamically leverages the information of the opinion target and the local context. Intuitively, the target-aware encoder catches the opinion target information, and the local context-aware decoder obtains the local context information from the relationship among surrounding words. Then, GRED employs a gate mechanism to dynamically aggregate the outputs of the encoder and the decoder. In addition, we adopt a pretrained language model Bidirectional and Auto-Regressive Transformer (BART), as the structure of GRED to improve the implicit language knowledge. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets show that GRED surpasses all the baseline models and achieves state-of-the-art performance.

As a result, it is critical that small marginal firms be capable of predicting financial crises in order to mitigate their negative impact. Financial Crisis Prediction (FCP) is the process of recognizing the possibility of a future financial crisis. FCP is an important task for financial institutions, policymakers, and investors because it helps them to prepare for and mitigate the negative impact of financial crisis. Machine learning (ML) approaches are used to forecast financial crisis in small and marginal firms. It is completed by training a model on historical data and using it to predict the likelihood of a future financial crisis. As a result, this article proposes a Modified Grey Wolf Optimizer with Sparse Autoencoder (MGWO-SAE) for predicting financial crisis situations in small marginal firms. The goal of the MGWO-SAE technique is to forecast financial crisis effectively in small marginal firms. To accomplish this, the proposed MGWO-SAE technique employs data preprocessing to convert the input financial data into the correct format. The MGWO-SAE technique employs the SAE classification method for prediction. The MGWO algorithm is used for hyperparameter tuning model to improve the performance of the SAE technique. The MGWO-SAE technique's experimental result analysis is tested on a financial dataset.

However, given a specific complicated task with complicated data, the process of building an effective deep learning-based system for anomaly detection still highly relies on human expertise and laboring trials. Also, while neural architecture search (NAS) has shown its promise in discovering effective deep architectures in various domains, such as image classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation, contemporary NAS methods are not suitable for anomaly detection due to the lack of intrinsic search space, unstable search process, and low sample efficiency. To bridge the gap, in this article, we propose AutoAD, an automated anomaly detection framework, which aims to search for an optimal neural network model within a predefined search space. Specifically, we first design a curiosity-guided search strategy to overcome the curse of local optimality. A controller, which acts as a search agent, is encouraged to take actions to maximize the information gain about the controller’s internal belief. We further introduce an experience replay mechanism based on self-imitation learning to improve the sample efficiency.

However, existing cross-domain models typically require large number of overlap users, which can be difficult to obtain in some applications. In addition, they did not consider the duality structure of cross-domain recommendation tasks, thus failing to take into account bidirectional latent relations between users and items and achieve optimal recommendation performance. To address these issues, in this paper we propose a novel cross-domain recommendation model based on dual learning that transfers information between two related domains in an iterative manner until the learning process stabilizes. We develop a novel latent orthogonal mapping to extract user preferences over multiple domains while preserving relations between users across different latent spaces. Furthermore, we combine the dual learning method with the metric learning approach, which allows us to significantly reduce the required common user overlap across the two domains and leads to even better cross-domain recommendation performance. We test the proposed model on two large-scale industrial datasets and six domain pairs, demonstrating that it consistently and significantly outperforms all the state-of-the-art baselines. We also show that the proposed model works well with very few overlap users to obtain satisfying recommendation performance comparable to the state-of-the-art baselines that use many overlap users.","1558-2191","","10.1109/TKDE.2021.3074395","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9409658","Cross domain recommendation;dual learning;metric learning;orthogonal mapping","Measurement;Transfer learning;Learning systems;Data models;Task analysis;Optimization;Motion pictures","learning (artificial intelligence);recommender systems","bidirectional latent relations;common user;cross domain recommender systems;cross-domain models;cross-domain recommendation model;cross-domain recommendation performance;cross-domain recommendation tasks;domain pairs;dual learning method;dual metric learning;latent orthogonal mapping;latent spaces;learning process;metric learning approach;optimal recommendation performance;overlap users;useful items;user preferences","","7","","78","IEEE","20 Apr 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Many models of trust and cybersecurity are based on cognitive assessments of risk prior to delegation of tasks, although it is known that trust and risk are associated [2]. Where delegation takes place without trust it is actions that influence the formation of trust, not the other way around. We argue that action shapes trust and is not merely a product of a process. It is known that consumers may delegate action to organisations as long as the perceived risks are lowered, and the inverted-U theory of trust [3] demonstrates that low trust marketplaces are regulated by guarantees that reduce the need for trust. Conversely, highly regulated marketplaces manage the rules of conduct to reduce the role of social trust. Therefore, trust is only necessary where the transaction types fall between these two poles and eliciting this trust can lead to competitive advantage [6]. This work utilises a model to operationalise the concepts in the Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB) [7,8] to measure how information security and task delegation drive consumers to trusting behaviour by increasing their perceived control and lowering perceived risks.","","978-1-83953-604-5","10.1049/icp.2021.2402","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9650937","","","behavioural sciences computing;consumer behaviour;security of data;trusted computing","computational trust formation;socio-technical environment;trust protocols;trust metrics;cybersecurity strategies;theory of planned behaviour;TPB;consumer behaviour;perceived risks","","","","","","15 Dec 2021","","","IET","IET Conferences"

To this end, we perform abandonment recognition on high-resolution remote sensing images.

The model integrates high-level semantic feature extraction and deep mining of low-level texture features to identify cropland abandonment. First, we labeled the abandoned cropland area and built the high-resolution abandoned cropland (HRAC) dataset, a high-resolution cropland abandonment dataset.

From the perspective of reducing the redundancy of video image sequence, this paper proposes a two-stage aerial video key frame extraction technology based on the fusion of the number of expected matching point pairs and UAV navigation information. Firstly, the algorithm uses high overlap rate to roughly extract the key frames of dense sequences, and then dynamically adjusts the number of inter frame matching point pairs and overlap rate to extract the fine key frames through optimization strategy. The test results on the open source aerial photographing data set created by Bu et al. show that this method can eliminate more than 92.3% redundant frames on average, and the processing speed of 1080P format aerial video sequence on general computer also reaches 31.4 frames per second. Compared with the key frame extraction method based only on navigation information, this method not only overcomes the problem of insufficient matching point pairs in the overlapping region, but also outputs matching point pair information which can be directly used in the subsequent image registration process, further improving the stitching speed.","","978-1-6654-7235-7","10.1109/ICMAE56000.2022.9852510","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9852510","aerial video sequence;key frame;matching point pair;navigation information;extraction","Navigation;Redundancy;Video sequences;Feature extraction;Autonomous aerial vehicles;Image sequences;Data mining","feature extraction;image matching;image registration;image resolution;image segmentation;image sequences;object detection;photogrammetry;sensor fusion;video signal processing","stage key frame extraction technology;aerial video image mosaic;expected point pair;navigation information fusion;high-precision image mosaic;UAV aerial photogrammetry;video image sequence data;video image stitching task;stitching accuracy;two-stage aerial video key frame extraction technology;expected matching point pairs;UAV navigation information;high overlap rate;dense sequences;inter frame;fine key frames;open source aerial photographing data;92.3% redundant frames;1080P format aerial video sequence;key frame extraction method;insufficient matching point pairs;point pair information;subsequent image registration process;stitching speed","","","","18","IEEE","17 Aug 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, in practical clinical applications, it is often difficult to obtain multi-modality MR images simultaneously due to patient discomfort, and scanning costs, etc. Therefore, how to effectively utilize the existing modality images to synthesize missing modality image has become a hot research topic. In this paper, we propose a novel confidence-guided aggregation and cross-modality refinement network (CACR-Net) for multi-modality MR image synthesis, which effectively utilizes complementary and correlative information of multiple modalities to synthesize high-quality target-modality images. Specifically, to effectively utilize the complementary modality-specific characteristics, a confidence-guided aggregation module is proposed to adaptively aggregate the multiple target-modality images generated from multiple source-modality images by using the corresponding confidence maps.

"Efficient Densest Subgraphs Discovery in Large Dynamic Graphs by Greedy Approximation","T. Han","National Center for Public Credit Information, Beijing, China","IEEE Access","25 May 2023","2023","11","","49367","49377","Densest subgraph detection has become an important primitive in graph mining tasks when analyzing communities and detecting events in a wide range of application domains. Currently, it is a challenging and practically crucial research issue to develop efficient densest subgraphs mining approaches that can handle both very large and continuously evolving graphs. Although large-scale or dynamic methods have been proposed to find the densest subgraphs, there is still a lack of a promising method to deal with large-scale and dynamically evolving graphs. In this paper, the problem is formulated and proved to be NP-Hard, an incremental greedy approximation approach is proposed, and its running time is O(m+n). In order to find the densest subgraph effectively by heuristically merging the local densest subgraphs, firstly, the edge flow of a dynamic graph is divided into several subgraphs in a given period of  $T $ . Secondly, a local candidate set is generated by local denser subgraph discovery. Third, the global densest subgraph candidates are collected by heuristically merging. Last, the densest subgraphs are induced from the global densest subgraph candidates with constraints by static densest subgraph discovery algorithm. This incremental approach enables us to scale up the existing densest subgraph discovery algorithms, which focus mainly on small and static graphs and thus can handle very large dynamic graphs. Experiments on real-world networks with billions of nodes for comprehensive evaluations present excellent improvement in efficiency and accuracy: it reduces about 25% running time on average and presents a more accurate estimation of the structure of a graph with more compact subgraphs than the static method.It also performs well when dealing with graphs of varying densities.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3277197","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10127973","Densest subgraphs;incremental greedy approximation;heuristically merging;local candidate;global densest subgraph candidates","Heuristic algorithms;Approximation algorithms;Greedy algorithms;Social networking (online);Density functional theory;Image edge detection;Data mining","approximation theory;computational complexity;data mining;graph theory;greedy algorithms;optimisation","dynamic graph;global densest subgraph candidates;graph mining tasks;incremental greedy approximation;large dynamic graphs;local denser subgraph discovery;NP-hard problem;static densest subgraph discovery algorithm","","","","56","CCBY","17 May 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Numerous deep-learning methods are booming to improve the performance of 2-D medical image segmentation, owing to the fast growth of the convolutional neural network. Generally, the manually defined ground truth is utilized directly to supervise models in the training phase. However, direct supervision of the ground truth often results in ambiguity and distractors as complex challenges appear simultaneously. To alleviate this issue, we propose a gradually recurrent network with curriculum learning, which is supervised by gradual information of the ground truth. The whole model is composed of two independent networks. One is the segmentation network denoted as GREnet, which formulates 2-D medical image segmentation as a temporal task supervised by pixel-level gradual curricula in the training phase. The other is a curriculum-mining network. To a certain degree, the curriculum-mining network provides curricula with an increasing difficulty in the ground truth of the training set by progressively uncovering hard-to-segmentation pixels via a data-driven manner. Given that segmentation is a pixel-level dense-prediction challenge, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to function 2-D medical image segmentation as a temporal task with pixel-level curriculum learning. In GREnet, the naive UNet is adopted as the backbone, while ConvLSTM is used to establish the temporal link between gradual curricula. In the curriculum-mining network, UNet $++$  supplemented by transformer is designed to deliver curricula through the outputs of the modified UNet $++$  at different layers. Experimental results have demonstrated the effectiveness of GREnet on seven datasets, i.e., three lesion segmentation datasets in dermoscopic images, an optic disc and cup segmentation dataset and a blood vessel segmentation dataset in retinal images, a breast lesion segmentation dataset in ultrasound images, and a lung segmentation dataset in computed tomography (CT).","2162-2388","","10.1109/TNNLS.2023.3238381","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61771233,61702182,62271221); Science and Technology Program of Guangzhou(grant numbers:202201011672); Science and Engineering Research Council (SERC) Central Research Fund (Use-inspired Basic Research); Singapore Government’s Research, and Innovation and Enterprise 2020 Plan (Advanced Manufacturing and Engineering Domain)(grant numbers:A18A1b0045); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10026671","Curriculum learning;data-driven curriculum;gradually recurrent network;medical image segmentation","Image segmentation;Biomedical imaging;Lesions;Task analysis;Training;Medical diagnostic imaging;Knowledge engineering","","","","1","","","IEEE","26 Jan 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

However, the completion of crowd-and-vehicle counting also faces challenges, such as large-scale variations, imbalanced data distribution, and insufficient local patterns. To tackle these challenges, we put forth a novel frequency feature pyramid network (FFPNet) in this paper. Our proposed FFPNet extracts the multi-scale information by frequency feature pyramid module, which can tackle the issue of large-scale variations. Meanwhile, the frequency feature pyramid module uses different frequency branches to obtain different scale information. We also adopt the attention mechanism to strength the extraction of different scale information. Moreover, we devise a novel loss function, namely global-local consistency loss, to address the existing problems of imbalanced data distribution and insufficient local patterns. Furthermore, we conduct extensive experiments on six datasets to evaluate our proposed FFPNet. It is worth mentioning that we also construct a novel crowd-and-vehicle dataset (CROVEH), which is the only dataset that contains both crowd-and-vehicle annotations. The experimental results show that FFPNet achieves the best performance on different backbones, e.g., 52.69 mean absolute error (MAE) on P2PNet with FFP module.

However, collisions and deadlocks between AGVs are inevitable. Many algorithms have been proposed to solve these problems, but their performance is inefficient in the WIP warehouse due to the lack of consideration of its features. In this paper, to fill the gap between current research and real-world application requirement, we construct a collision and deadlock solving model for a multi-AGV system in a WIP warehouse (CDSMWW). Then we propose a coordination strategy based on dynamic spare point application (DSPA), aiming to improve the efficiency of solving AGV collisions and deadlocks in a WIP warehouse. In this method, the AGV records its predecessor, successor, and reserved points in its local controller and can only enter the set of sequential shared points if its application for spare points is successful. Otherwise, it has to stop to avoid causing an unresolvable deadlock. If a deadlock occurs while this AGV is in the sequential shared points, the AGV moves to the spare point to resolve it. Whenever an AGV leaves the set of consecutive shared points, it releases all its spare points. We apply the algorithm to both the central and local controllers to improve the calculation efficiency. Extensive simulation results demonstrate the feasibility of the DSPA scheme under realistic WIP warehouse environment and its higher efficiency compared to previous state-of-the-art methods.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3195173","Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory(grant numbers:2020B121201001); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62106098); Stable Support Plan Program of Shenzhen Natural Science Fund(grant numbers:20200925154942002); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9845408","AGVs;WIP warehouse;collision and deadlock resolution;dynamic spare point application","System recovery;Vehicle dynamics;Heuristic algorithms;Workstations;Task analysis;Layout;Dynamic scheduling","automatic guided vehicles;collision avoidance;multi-robot systems;warehouse automation","sequential shared points;consecutive shared points;dynamic spare point application;coordination strategy;multiAGV system;AGV collisions;WIP warehouse environment;multiautomated guided vehicle;work-in-process warehouses;AGV deadlocks;material transportation","","1","","29","CCBY","1 Aug 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Its key task is how to extract sufficient fusion features from multi-view data. Because the nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) can favorably explain the extracted features, the NMF based MVC is usually a good choice for multi-view data, and promising results are achieved. Inspired by this, we propose a multi-view graph regularized deep autoencoder-like NMF (MGANMF) framework in this paper for multi-view clustering. MGANMF uses the deep autoencoder-like NMF, which draws lessons from the idea of depth automatic encoder, to learn the hierarchical semantics of multi-view data in a layer-wise manner. Moreover, in order to describe the inherent geometric structure in each view data, graph regulators are introduced to couple the output representation of deep structure. In addition, the self-updating weights are employed to balance the effect of each view. Thus, a new objective function is defined and the optimization processes are presented. Experimental results on several multi-view datasets show the effectiveness of the proposed model.","","978-1-7281-6327-7","10.1109/ICASSP49357.2023.10096588","Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities; National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10096588","deep autoencoder-like NMF;multi-view clustering;graph regulators","Regulators;Clustering methods;Semantics;Signal processing;Feature extraction;Linear programming;Data mining","","","","","","22","IEEE","5 May 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, there exist so-called semantic gaps among different kinds of buildings due to the large intraclass variance of buildings, and most of the present-day methods are ineffective in extracting various buildings in large areas that cover different scenes, for example, urban villages and high-rise buildings, because existing building extraction strategies are the same for various scenes. With the improvement of the resolution of remote sensing images, it is feasible to improve the image interpretation based on the scene prior. However, this idea has not been fully utilized in building extraction from VHR remote sensing imagery. This study proposes a scene-driven multitask parallel attention convolutional network (MTPA-Net) to resolve these limitations. The proposed approach classifies the input image into multilabel scenes and further separately maps the buildings in pixel level under different scenes. In addition, a simple postprocessing method is applied to integrate the building extraction results and scene prior. Our proposed method does not require multimodel training and the network can learn in an end-to-end manner.

Variable operating conditions of the bearing and difficulty in obtaining corresponding data labels in the industry result in low prediction accuracy of the model. To solve these problems, a bearing life prediction model based on an improved temporal convolutional network and transfer learning is proposed. First, the squeeze-and-excitation network is used to mine and recalibrate the deep features of source domain data. Second, the temporal convolutional network is used to calibrate the relationship between the features and lifetime, and the optimal source domain model is trained. Finally, the transfer learning training is conducted with the source domain model to obtain the transfer model, which can accurately predict the remaining life of the multi-operating condition signal.

These fields include financial services, transportation, healthcare, e-commerce, retail, etc. wherein Machine Learning has been used for innovation, transformation, and optimization to get highly promising results. In today’s world, Machine Learning is not used only for research and development applications but also in the enterprise domain. However, traditional Machine Learning methods are dependent on humans and that is not a feasible option for businesses having limited resources and those which cannot invest in a highly qualified data science team. Even in the case of Machine Learning engineers who are in high demand across various industries, improving the efficiency of tasks related to Machine Learning has become a challenge. This calls for the creation of an application that can automate the end-to-end process of applying machine learning solutions to real-world problems. “AMES: Automated ML Expert System” will make Machine Learning truly available, even to people with minimal expertise in this field. Such a system will increase productivity by automating repetitive tasks, help to avoid errors that might creep in due to manual processes, and democratize Machine Learning by making the power of ML accessible to everybody. Tasks such as Hyperparameter Optimization, feature engineering, data preprocessing, visualization, and even model selection, if automated, will prove to be of great benefit to ML engineers and novice users alike.

However, the utilization of optical remote sensing data suffers from the limitation of bad weather and cloud contamination. To address aforementioned issue and enhance spatial details of polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (PolSAR) image, a novel dual-domain super-resolution image fusion method is proposed by combining improved spherically invariant random vector (ISIRV) model with generalized adaptive linear combination approximation (GALCA) technology in this study. The proposed method decomposes the task of image fusion into polarimetric and texture domain fusion by integrating polarimetric components of PolSAR image and texture detail component of panchromatic image, which can significantly improve spatial resolutions of the PolSAR image while preserving polarimetric information. The data fusion experiment is implemented with three data sets including panchromatic images of Gaofen-1 (GF-1) and Gaofen-2 (GF-2) and the quad-pol SAR data of Gaofen-3 (GF-3) and Radarsat-2. Results show that the proposed dual-domain image fusion method provides a better performance compared with state-of-the-art multisensor fusion methods (BT, PCA, GS, indusion, and PRACS) regarding qualitative and quantitative evaluations.

Echo state network (ESN) is frequently employed in the realm of chaotic time series modeling and prediction, but the basic ESN has been proved to have an antagonistic tradeoff between nonlinear transformation and memory capacity. To overcome this tradeoff, a new architecture named hierarchical ESN with augmented random features (HESN-ARF) is proposed. On the basis of the traditional linear random projection, the proposed HESN-ARF further leverages nonlinear kernel transformation to construct augmented random features, which can enable the linear and nonlinear properties to be fully represented. Moreover, the HESN-ARF utilizes low-rank kernel approximation to further reduce the computational cost, preserving the advantage of efficient modeling as much as possible while ensuring the capacities of nonlinear transformation and dynamical memory simultaneously.

Although existing studies have made efforts towards this and achieved decent performance, they are restricted to shallow models and how to mine deeper information from multiple views remains to be investigated. As a recently emerged neural network, Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) exploits graph structure to propagate label signals and has achieved encouraging performance, and it has been widely employed in various fields. Nonetheless, research on solving multi-view learning problems via GCN is limited and lacks interpretability. To address this gap, in this paper we propose a framework termed Interpretable Multi-view Graph Convolutional Network (IMvGCN). We first combine the reconstruction error and Laplacian embedding to formulate a multi-view learning problem that explores the original space from feature and topology perspectives. In light of a series of derivations, we establish a potential connection between GCN and multi-view learning, which holds significance for both domains. Furthermore, we propose an orthogonal normalization method to guarantee the mathematical connection, which solves the intractable problem of orthogonal constraints in deep learning. In addition, the proposed framework is applied to the multi-view semi-supervised learning task. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method over other state-of-the-art methods.","1941-0077","","10.1109/TMM.2023.3260649","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:U21A20472,62276065); National Key Research and Development Plan of China(grant numbers:2021YFB3600503); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10080867","Graph convolutional network;interpretable deep learning;orthogonal normalization;multi-view semi-supervised classification","Convolutional neural networks;Semisupervised learning;Laplace equations;Matrix decomposition;Neural networks;Deep learning;Task analysis","","","","3","","","IEEE","23 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

From this cut-points vector, the decision of deleting or selecting any feature is induced. Indeed, the number of generated cut-points varies from one feature to another. Thus, the higher the number of cut-points, the higher the probability of selecting the considered feature and vice versa. This fact leads to the deletion of possibly important features having a single or a low number of cut-points, such as the infection rate, the glycemia level, and the blood pressure. In order to solve the issue of the dependency relation between the feature selection (or removal) event and the number of its generated potential cut-points, we propose to model the discretization-based feature selection task as a bi-level optimization problem and then solve it using an improved version of an existing co-evolutionary algorithm, named I-CEMBA. The latter ensures the variation of the number of features during the migration process in order to deal with the multimodality aspect. The resulting algorithm, termed Bi-DFS (Bi-level Discretization-based Feature Selection), performs selection at the upper level while discretization is done at the lower level. The experimental results on several high-dimensional datasets show that Bi-DFS outperforms relevant state-of-the-art methods in terms of classification accuracy, generalization ability, and feature selection bias.","1941-0026","","10.1109/TEVC.2022.3192113","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9832651","Discretization-based feature selection;features interactions;cut-points search;bi-level optimization;co-evolutionary algorithm","Feature extraction;Task analysis;Machine learning algorithms;Machine learning;Data mining;Metaheuristics;Genetic algorithms","","","","","","","IEEE","18 Jul 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

Therefore, the capability of effective and efficient uplift modeling is essential for advertising platforms to attract and satisfy their customers (i.e., advertisers). In practical advertising applications, uplift modeling focuses on the estimation of the uplift effect caused by ad exposure. It is not a trivial task to estimate such causal impact of ad exposure at the individual level. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end approach for explicit uplift modeling, using data collected from Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs) in large-scale real-world advertising platforms. More specifically, we first introduce the Explicit Uplift Effect Network (EUEN) to explicitly model the uplift effect and demonstrate its advantages in uplift modeling. Then for the exposure uplift effect modeling, we further propose the Explicit Exposure Uplift Effect Network (EEUEN), which can correct the exposure bias for uplift modeling.

In this paper, a multi-scenario optimization evolutionary algorithm based on transfer framework is proposed. In one iteration, for each sce-nario, its knee solutions are recognized as its transfer candidates and are used to construct a constraint hyperplane, which deter-mines whether transfer candidates from other scenarios can be the transferable solutions in this underlying scenario. Then, among all transfer candidates, those accepted by all scenarios are identified as the public compromised optimal solutions and stored in archive. Afterwards, archive updating process is applied to guarantee the optimality of solutions in archive and control the size of archive. Finally, each scenario’s accepted transferable solutions are uti-lized in its offspring generation, thus achieving information trans-fer between different scenarios.

This research investigates aspects of automatic text summarization from the perspectives of single and multiple documents. Summarization is a task of condensing huge text articles into short, summarized versions. The text is reduced in size for summarization purpose but preserving key vital information and retaining the meaning of the original document. This study presents the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) approach used to perform topic modelling from summarised medical science journal articles with topics related to genes and diseases. In this study, PyLDAvis web-based interactive visualization tool was used to visualise the selected topics. The visualisation provides an overarching view of the main topics while allowing and attributing deep meaning to the prevalence individual topic. This study presents a novel approach to summarization of single and multiple documents. The results suggest the terms ranked purely by considering their probability of the topic prevalence within the processed document using extractive summarization technique. PyLDAvis visualization describes the flexibility of exploring the terms of the topics’ association to the fitted LDA model. The topic modelling result shows prevalence within topics 1 and 2. This association reveals that there is similarity between the terms in topic 1 and 2 in this study. The efficacy of the LDA and the extractive summarization methods were measured using Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) and Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation (ROUGE) metrics to evaluate the reliability and validity of the model.","","978-1-6654-8045-1","10.1109/BigData55660.2022.10020259","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10020259","Summarization;extractive;abstractive;Latent Dirichlet Allocation;topic modelling;visualisation;ROUGE","Analytical models;Text analysis;Computational modeling;Semantics;Big Data;Predictive models;Data models","data mining;data visualisation;diseases;electronic publishing;information retrieval;Internet;linear discriminant analysis;medical information systems;natural language processing;text analysis","automated text summarization;automatic text summarization;big data mining;data-driven latent semantic analysis;extractive summarization methods;extractive summarization technique;huge text articles;latent dirichlet allocation;LDA topic modelling;PyLDAvis Web-based interactive visualization tool;summarised medical science journal articles;summarization purpose;text analysis;topic modelling result;topic prevalence","","","","36","IEEE","26 Jan 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The sustainability and stability of the grid system are threatened by the unexpected electricity losses. Energy theft detection based on data analysis is one of the solutions to alleviate the drawbacks of NTL. The main problem of data-based NTL detection is that collected electricity usage dataset is imbalanced. In this paper, we approach the NTL detection problem using deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to solve the data imbalanced problem of NTL.

Moreover, extra pre-processing steps to balance the dataset are unnecessary to detect NTL compared to the conventional NTL detection algorithms.

In recent years, mobile edge computing (MEC) has risen as promising paradigm within the internet of things era bringing benefits to the proximity of mobile terminals, leveraging intelligent computations offloading services to address the severity of their resource scarcity. Yet, embracing mobile edge-based services to augment personas resources and performance raises new concerns including determining what computations to offload for serving the highest number of mobile devices and reducing the remote execution fees imposed on the institution. In this context, we propose new cost-effective MEC-based solution to address these issues. We develop two-level multi-objective optimization realized through an intelligent offloading decision model able to settle both concerns, by minimizing processing, memory and energy while augmenting virtual mobile instances performance on a wide range of physical devices with minimal offloading service fees. We also propose a redesigned smart genetic-based method able to accelerate and reduce the overhead of offloading decision evaluation. Extensive analysis is performed and the results show that our proposition can get more quickly the offloading strategy than other schemes. The results also demonstrate the ability to enforce the virtual mobile devices by reducing local processing, memory usage, energy consumption and execution time along with acceptable minimal additional fees compared to other techniques.","1558-2566","","10.1109/TNET.2021.3066558","École de Technologie Supérieure (ETS); Lebanese American University (LAU); Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council (NSERC), Canada; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9385940","\boldsymbol Multi-Persona mobile computing;intelligent offloading;mobile edge computing;multi-objective optimization;resource management;computation cost","Mobile handsets;Task analysis;Performance evaluation;Optimization;Medical services;Business;Mobile computing","cloud computing;genetic algorithms;mobile computing;mobility management (mobile radio);virtualisation","virtual mobile devices;multipersona mobility;joint cost-effective;resource-aware mobile-edge computation offloading;multipersona mobile computing;personal devices;mobile edge computing;mobile terminals;intelligent computations offloading services;resource scarcity;mobile edge-based services;personas resources;cost-effective MEC-based solution;two-level multiobjective optimization;intelligent offloading decision model;augmenting virtual mobile instances performance;physical devices;minimal offloading service fees;redesigned smart genetic-based method;offloading strategy","","12","","38","IEEE","24 Mar 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Therefore, it is necessary to mix different modulation formats in the communication network to meet these requirements. Modulation format recognition (MFR) technology is therefore widely used at the receiving end to improve the performance of subsequent digital signal processing (DSP) algorithms. Compared with traditional machine learning (ML), deep learning (DL) has achieved amazing achievements in classification tasks in recent years.

It focuses on process and project improvement in different fields and emphasizes a team's ability to improve the efficiency of day-to-day activities by implementing the core practices (e.g., visualizing workflow, limiting work-in-progress, managing flow). The efficiency of day-to-day activities is crucial in every process, yet, recent times have called for a new out-of-the-box approach to address the challenges companies face. While the literature review presents efficiency improvements through the use of the core practices, one of the biggest problems while implementing Kanban is shown to be the setting of effective work-in-progress limits. This article addresses this issue and proves that the workflow does not exclusively depend on the work-in-progress limits—as the core practices suggest—but on determining the optimal relationship (solution) among the replenishment value, resource capacity, and work-in-progress limits. Such an approach ensures that the workflow pace on the Kanban board is sustainable by reducing the number of work items in queues as well as people's idleness. The proposed empirical approach runs a series of simulation scenarios aimed at helping to identify the optimal relationship among the three mentioned elements for generating a sustainable workflow pace and minimizing work/people's idleness.","1558-0040","","10.1109/TEM.2021.3120984","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9611021","Agile project management;Kanban method;replenishment;resource capacity;work-in-progress (WIP) limits","Task analysis;Software;Project management;Visualization;Standards;Feedback loop;Continuous improvement","","","","","","","IEEE","10 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

Existing methods, such as the Multivariate Hawkes processes, mostly assumed that each sequence is independent and identically distributed. However, in many real-world applications, it is commonplace to encounter a topological network behind the event sequences such that an event is excited or inhibited not only by its history but also by its topological neighbors. Consequently, the failure in describing the topological dependency among the event sequences leads to the error detection of the causal structure. By considering the Hawkes processes from the view of temporal convolution, we propose a topological Hawkes process (THP) to draw a connection between the graph convolution in the topology domain and the temporal convolution in time domains. We further propose a causal structure learning method on THP in a likelihood framework. The proposed method is featured with the graph convolution-based likelihood function of THP and a sparse optimization scheme with an Expectation-Maximization of the likelihood function.

Most recent works show that visual information can boost the NER performance since images can provide complementary contextual information for texts. However, the image-level features ignore the mapping relations between fine-grained visual objects and textual entities, which results in error detection in entities with different types. To better exploit visual and textual information in NER, we propose an adversarial gated bilinear attention neural network (AGBAN). The model jointly extracts entity-related features from both visual objects and texts, and leverages an adversarial training to map two different representations into a shared representation. As a result, domain information contained in an image can be transferred and applied for extracting named entities in the text associated with the image. Experimental results on Tweets dataset demonstrate that our model outperforms the state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, we systematically evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed gated bilinear attention network in capturing the interactions of mutimodal features visual objects and textual words. Our results indicate that the adversarial training can effectively exploit commonalities across heterogeneous data sources, which leads to improved performance in NER when compared to models purely exploiting text data or combining the image-level visual features.","1941-0077","","10.1109/TMM.2020.3013398","Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, SCUT(grant numbers:2017ZD048,D2182480); Science and Technology Planning Project of Guangdong Province(grant numbers:2017B050506004); Science and Technology Programs of Guangzhou(grant numbers:201704030076,201802010027,201902010046); CUHK Research Committee Funding(grant numbers:EE16963); Hong Kong Research Grants Council(grant numbers:C1031-18 G); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9154571","Named entity recognition;social media posts;adversarial training;bilinear attention network","Visualization;Social network services;Feature extraction;Task analysis;Logic gates;Data mining;Training","data mining;data visualisation;feature extraction;learning (artificial intelligence);natural language processing;neural nets;social networking (online);text analysis","object-aware multimodal named Entity Recognition;social media posts;adversarial learning;visual information;NER performance;complementary contextual information;image-level features;mapping relations;fine-grained visual objects;textual entities;error detection;textual information;bilinear attention neural network;entity-related features;adversarial training;map two different representations;shared representation;domain information;named entities;bilinear attention network;mutimodal features visual objects;textual words;text data;image-level visual features","","10","","54","IEEE","3 Aug 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The data holder or data service provider may not have a clear understanding of data interference. The solution to these two problems depends on the capability of predicting the data utility in advance, which raises a fundamental question: to what degree is the data utility predictable?

The gap between theoretical upper bounds and achievable lower bounds indicates that the achievable lower bounds can still be optimized for performance.","2329-924X","","10.1109/TCSS.2020.3035462","National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2018YFB2100801); National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)(grant numbers:61972287); Major Project of the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology of China(grant numbers:[2018] 282); Postgraduate Education Reform and Research Project of Tongji University(grant numbers:ZD1903031); Municipal Human Resources Development Program for Outstanding Young Talents in Shanghai; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9269410","Achievable bound;data utility;fundamental limits;identity authentication;machine learning;upper bound","Authentication;Data models;Big Data;Organizations;Upper bound;Entropy;Interference","authorisation;Big Data;business data processing;deep learning (artificial intelligence)","information-theoretic bounds;data service provider;data utility prediction;business requirements;learning algorithms;deep learning technologies;machine learning;big data;data-driven identity authentication;fundamental limits;real-world data;achievable lower bounds;data interference;data holder","","2","","45","IEEE","24 Nov 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this paper, we propose a novel technique based on pretrained language models and it aims to predict a component of an issue report. Our approach fine-tunes the pretrained language models to conduct multilabel classifications. The proposed approach outperforms the previous state-of-the-art method by more than 30% with respect to the recall at  ${k}$  on all the datasets considered in our experiment.

This pandemic has fasten the transformation of PLN business process, from supply driven into demand driven business. PLN UP3 Lhokseumawe challenged to improve their services and energy transaction. In order to achieve the goals, it is suggested to improve services of new installment for 3-phase energy meter without expansion. Previously the task can only be done with at least 3 days of works. It was mainly due to many steps required to assemble the metering box. This paper proposed the usage of portable smart energy meter that can replace the metering box during assembly phase. The device can also accommodate several power options that can adjust with the customer's current plan. Thus, by implementing the portable box, customers can enjoy the electricity by the same day instead of previous 3 days. The result from energy meter showed that based on Ibase, with load of 100%, 75%, 50% and 25% resulted in 0.0538%, 0.0619%, 0.0139% and 0.0335% respectively. The result from CT Ratio error with 100/5, 150/5, 200/5, 250/5 and 300/5 showed as -0.26%, -0.32%, -0.23%, 0.15% and -0.17% respectively. The result was in range which mean that smart energy meter portable was tested on good condition. The use of this device can shorten the service delivery time, especially on new installment for 3-phase energy meter without expansion of power between 53 to 197 kVA. This solution is advantageous both for PLN customers and the corporation itself.","","979-8-3503-1027-6","10.1109/ICT-PEP57242.2022.9988874","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9988874","portable;metering;low voltage","Meters;COVID-19;Low voltage;Pandemics;Voltage;Power systems;Behavioral sciences","power meters;smart meters","3-phase energy meter;apparent power 53.0 kVA to 197.0 kVA;assembly phase;Covid-19 outbreak;demand driven business;electricity usage;energy transaction;low voltage customer;metering box;PLN business process;PLN UP3 Lhokseumawe;portable smart energy meter;time 3.0 d","","","","13","IEEE","29 Dec 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This article proposes FTS, which is a novel model for faceted text segmentation via multitask learning (MTL). FTS models faceted text segmentation as an MTL problem with text segmentation and facet annotation. This model employs the bidirectional long short-term memory (Bi-LSTM) network to learn the feature representation of sentences within a document. The feature representation is shared and adjusted with common parameters by MTL, which can help an optimization model to learn a better-shared and robust feature representation from text segmentation to facet annotation. Moreover, the text segmentation is modeled as a sequence tagging task using LSTM with a conditional random fields (CRFs) classification layer. Extensive experiments are conducted on five data sets from five domains: data structure, data mining, computer network, solid mechanics, and crystallography. The results indicate that the FTS model outperforms several highly cited and state-of-the-art approaches related to text segmentation and facet annotation.","2162-2388","","10.1109/TNNLS.2020.3015996","National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2017YFB1401300,2017YFB1401302); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61672419,61672418,61877050,61937001); MoE-CMCC “Artifical Intelligence” Project(grant numbers:MCM20190701); Innovative Research Group of the National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61721002); Project of China Knowledge Centre for Engineering Science and Technology; Consulting Research Project of Chinese Academy of Engineering “The Online and Offline Mixed Educational Service System for ‘The Belt and Road’ Training in MOOC China”; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9187579","Facet annotation;long short-term memory;multitask learning (MTL);text segmentation","Task analysis;Semantics;Data mining;Probabilistic logic;Electronic mail;Data structures;Computational modeling","data mining;data structures;information retrieval;learning (artificial intelligence);natural language processing;text analysis","multitask learning;FTS models faceted text segmentation;facet annotation","","3","","61","IEEE","7 Sep 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

First, the curse of dimensionality degrades the performance of many practical data processing techniques. Second, due to the existence of noise and outliers, feature extraction on corrupted data cannot be effectively achieved. Recently, some representation based methods have produced promising results. However, these methods cannot handle the case in which nonlinear similarity exists and have failed to provide the quantized interpretability for the importance of features. In this paper, we propose a novel low rank and sparse representation method to realize dimensionality reduction and robustly extract latent low dimensional discriminative features. Specifically, we first adopt multiple kernel learning to map the original data into an embedded reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) and then kernel based similarity discriminative projection is learned to explore the within-class and between-class variability. Notably, this low dimensional feature learning strategy is definitely integrated into the low rank matrix recovery of the kernel matrix. Next, we introduce the regularization of  $l_{2,1}$  norm on error matrix to eliminate noise and on projection matrix to lead the selected features to be more compact and interpretable. The non-convex optimization problem is effectively solved by the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) methods. Extensive experiments on seven benchmark datasets are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.","1558-2205","","10.1109/TCSVT.2021.3087643","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62106107,61876087); Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province, China (Youth Fund Project)(grant numbers:BK20210560); Natural Science Research of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions of China(grant numbers:21KJB520011); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9523854","Data representation;dimensionality reduction;feature selection;kernel;low-rank embedding;l₂,₁ norm","Kernel;Feature extraction;Dimensionality reduction;Optimization;Sparse matrices;Task analysis;Support vector machines","data mining;feature extraction;Hilbert spaces;image representation;learning (artificial intelligence);matrix algebra","alternating direction method;between-class variability;corrupted data;data mining;embedded reproducing kernel Hilbert space;error matrix;feature extraction;kernel matrix;latent low dimensional discriminative features;low dimensional feature learning strategy;low rank matrix recovery;multiple kernel dimensionality reduction;multipliers methods;nonconvex optimization problem;nonlinear similarity;novel low rank;pattern recognition;practical data;projection matrix;quantized interpretability;representation based methods;representation method;robust low rank;similarity discriminative projection;sparse representation","","1","","55","IEEE","26 Aug 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Moreover, for the lack of multiscale features extraction and fusion, they are difficult to extract different scale farmland parcels accurately. Based on these issues, we propose a fuzzy-boundary enhanced trident network, named FBETNet, to enhance the feature of fuzzy boundary and generate multiscale parcels. First, a semantic-guided multitask strategy is introduced in order to enhance the feature of fuzzy boundary. Second, we design a multiscale trident module to further improve the performance of multiscale feature extraction. Finally, an adversarial data augmentation strategy is employed in the training phase to strengthen the robustness and stability of our proposed method.

To address the issue, we propose a unique multiple instance graph (MIG) learning framework for WSOD in RSIs. The motivation of this work is twofold: 1) a spatial graph-based vote (SGV) mechanism is proposed to find high-quality objects by collecting the top-ranking votes with highly spatial overlap and 2) an appearance graph-based instance mining (AGIM) model is further constructed to exploit all possible instances with the same class by propagating the label information according to the apparent similarity. It is noted that the formulated MIG framework that collaborates SGV and AGIM is independent of extra hyperparameters or annotations.

Simultaneously, different tasks often need to be modeled separately. Domain adaptation, as one of the research contents of transfer learning, has certain advantages in solving the problem of inconsistent feature distribution. This article designs and establishes a domain adaptation framework based on multiscale mixed domain feature (DA-MMDF) for cross-domain intelligent fault diagnosis of rolling bearings under polytropic working conditions. The proposed method first uses the MMDF extractor to obtain features from the collected data, which constructs a complete feature space through variational mode decomposition (VMD) and mixed domain feature extraction to fully mine the state information and intrinsic attributes of the vibration signal. Second, the dimensionality reduction and optimization of features are achieved through extreme gradient promotion, and meaningful and sensitive features are selected according to the importance of features to eliminate redundant information. The optimized important features are combined with the manifold embedded distribution alignment method to realize the distribution alignment of data in different fields and cross-domain diagnosis. In order to verify the effectiveness of the proposed approach, the rolling bearing data sets gathered from the laboratories are employed and analyzed. The analysis result confirms that DA-MMDF is able to achieve effective transfer diagnosis between polytropic working conditions.

However, since social images contain both multimodal contents (e.g., visual images and textual descriptions) and social relations among images, simply modeling the content information may lead to suboptimal embedding. In this paper, we propose a novel multimodal representation learning model for social images, that is, correlational multimodal variational autoencoder (CMVAE) via triplet network. Specifically, in order to mine the highly nonlinear correlation between the visual content and the textual content, a CMVAE is proposed to learn a unified representation for the multiple modalities of social images. Both common information in all modalities and private information in each modality are encoded for the representation learning. To incorporate the social relations among images, we employ the triplet network to embed multiple types of social links in the representation learning.

However, CNNs are computationally expensive, making them unfavorable for resource-limited devices with real-time constraints. Recent advances in neural architectures search (NAS) promise opportunities in automated optimization for disparity estimation. However, the main challenge of the NAS methods is the significant amount of computing time to explore a vast search space [e.g.,  $1.6\times 10^{29}$ ] and costly training candidates. To reduce the NAS computational demand, many proxy-based NAS methods have been proposed. Despite their success, most of them are designed for comparatively small-scale learning tasks. In this article, we propose a fast NAS method, called FastStereoNet, to enable resource-aware NAS within an intractably large search space. FastStereoNet automatically searches for hardware-friendly CNN architectures based on late acceptance hill climbing (LAHC), followed by simulated annealing (SA). FastStereoNet also employs a fine-tuning with a transferred weights mechanism to improve the convergence of the search process. The collection of these ideas provides competitive results in terms of search time and strikes a balance between accuracy and efficiency. Compared to the state of the art, FastStereoNet provides  $5.25\times $  reduction in search time and  $44.4\times $  reduction in model size. These benefits are attained while yielding a comparable accuracy that enables seamless deployment of disparity estimation on resource-limited devices. Finally, FastStereoNet significantly improves the perception quality of disparity estimation deployed on field-programmable gate array and Intel Neural Compute Stick 2 accelerator in a significantly less onerous manner.","2168-2232","","10.1109/TSMC.2021.3123136","Swedish Knowledge Foundation (KKS) through DeepMaker and DPAC Projects; VINNOVA through AutoDeep Project; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9609009","Disparity estimation;machine vision;neural architecture search;optimization;transfer learning","Computer architecture;Estimation;Task analysis;Field programmable gate arrays;Neural networks;Training;Graphics processing units","convolutional neural nets;learning (artificial intelligence);simulated annealing;stereo image processing","fast NAS method;hardware-friendly CNN architectures;Intel neural compute stick 2 accelerator;fast neural architecture search;resource-limited platforms;convolutional neural networks;resource-aware NAS computational demand;FastStereoNet;LAHC;late acceptance hill climbing;SA;simulated annealing;field-programmable gate array","","5","","66","CCBYNCND","9 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) provide a favoured prospect for automatic polyp segmentation and evade the limitations of visual inspection, e.g., subjectivity and overwork. However, most existing CNNs-based methods often provide unsatisfactory segmentation performance. In this paper, we propose a novel boundary constraint network, namely BCNet, for accurate polyp segmentation. The success of BCNet benefits from integrating cross-level context information and leveraging edge information. Specifically, to avoid the drawbacks caused by simple feature addition or concentration, BCNet applies a cross-layer feature integration strategy (CFIS) in fusing the features of the top-three highest layers, yielding a better performance. CFIS consists of three attention-driven cross-layer feature interaction modules (ACFIMs) and two global feature integration modules (GFIMs). ACFIM adaptively fuses the context information of the top-three highest layers via the self-attention mechanism instead of direct addition or concentration. GFIM integrates the fused information across layers with the guidance from global attention. To obtain accurate boundaries, BCNet introduces a bilateral boundary extraction module that explores the polyp and non-polyp information of the shallow layer collaboratively based on the high-level location information and boundary supervision. Through joint supervision of the polyp area and boundary, BCNet is able to get more accurate polyp masks. Experimental results on three public datasets show that the proposed BCNet outperforms seven state-of-the-art competing methods in terms of both effectiveness and generalization.","2168-2208","","10.1109/JBHI.2022.3173948","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62001302,62071309,62103286); Basic and Applied Basic Research Foundation of Guangdong Province(grant numbers:2021A1515011348,2019A1515111205,2019A1515110401); Shenzhen Science and Technology Program(grant numbers:RCBS2020071411,4920379); Natural Science Foundation of Shenzhen(grant numbers:JCYJ20190808145011259); Tencent; Social Science Youth Foundation of Ministry of Education of China(grant numbers:21YJC630181); State Key Laboratory of Virtual Reality Technology and Systems; Beihang University(grant numbers:VRLAB2021C05); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9772424","Polyp segmentation;deep network;boundary constraint;cross-layer feature integration;endoscope","Feature extraction;Shape;Data mining;Image segmentation;Bioinformatics;Endoscopes;Task analysis","computerised tomography;convolutional neural nets;deep learning (artificial intelligence);endoscopes;feature extraction;image classification;image fusion;image segmentation;medical image processing;object detection","self-attention mechanism;GFIM;bilateral boundary extraction module;shallow layer;high-level location information;boundary supervision;polyp area;accurate polyp masks;boundary constraint network;cross layer feature integration;proper polyp localization;endoscopy images;surgical planning;convolutional neural networks;automatic polyp segmentation;BCNet benefits;cross-level context information;integration strategy;CFIS;attention-driven cross-layer feature interaction modules;ACFIM;global feature integration modules","Humans;Image Processing, Computer-Assisted;Neural Networks, Computer","8","","56","IEEE","10 May 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, most of the traditional semisupervised neural network detection frameworks are complex to train and require additional structural analysis, along with a fixed structure, lacking universality. In this article, a semisupervised adaptive ladder network (SSALN) for remote sensing image CD is proposed, which enables dual-input label-incremental architecture searching with a concise and variable structure. First, SSALN is suitable for CD from two remote sensing images of any type with the characteristic of minimal label dependency and automatic network structure adjustment. The network can generate more reliable pseudolabels through continuous iterations to help limited real labels exploit implicit information, identify the most effective network, and form the ascending network structure optimization. Second, the acquisition of pseudolabels is the fusion of semisupervised and unsupervised CD approaches, which ensures the multiperspective information supplement. Multiple CD maps are fused to generate labels for the next iteration, making the predicting more reliable. Finally, both homogenous images and heterogenous images are tested with experiments. Even if the detection object is switched, it can be well adaptive and compatible without manual modification of the network. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can promote the flow of label information through structure searching and self-circulation in the ascending network optimization; thus, it has outstanding performance on tasks of remote sensing image CD.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2022.3158741","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62076204); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9732943","Adaptive structure;change detection (CD);genetic algorithm;remote sensing image;semisupervised network","Remote sensing;Training;Task analysis;Feature extraction;Neural networks;Data mining;Adaptive systems","geophysical image processing;neural nets;optimisation;remote sensing;semi-supervised learning (artificial intelligence)","semisupervised adaptive ladder network;remote sensing image change detection;SSALN;remote sensing image CD;dual-input label-incremental architecture;minimal label dependency;automatic network structure adjustment;ascending network structure optimization;semisupervised CD;unsupervised CD;multiple CD maps;homogenous images;heterogenous images;detection object;structure searching;semisupervised neural network detection","","34","","73","IEEE","10 Mar 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The methodological basis of the study is a systematic approach to the study of issues of development and improving the efficiency of the transport process in agricultural production, by modeling and optimizing the required number of cars. The study was carried out by economic and mathematical modeling of the composition of the harvesting and transport complex. Methods of linear mathematical programming were used. It has been established that the optimization of the parameters of the transport process of harvesting and transporting crop of cereals it is an actual task. For the continuous delivery of the mowed cereals to the place of storage without interrupting technological operations, the total productivity of vehicles (cars or tractor carts) must correspond to the actual productivity of harvesting aggregates (forage harvesters). At the same time, the number of transport units for specific harvesting conditions should be optimal according to the criterion of minimum energy costs for transporting crop of cereals. To develop the optimization model, the following assumptions were made: the harvesting and transport group of the storage complex is a combination of the same type of forage harvesters and vehicles of the same carrying capacity; the cereals e is loaded into a vehicle moving next to the combine, and then delivered to the place of storage, at that time the combine is waiting for the vehicle to return; the duration of the working cycles of the combine and the vehicle are taken as constant and multiple values, that is, a deterministic model is used. The number of vehicles at which the specific energy costs during harvesting and transportation of green mass to the storage will be minimal will be optimal for the harvesting and transport complex under consideration. Optimization mathematical model has been developed for the transport service process of forage harvesters that takes into account the conditions of this process. The criterion for the effectiveness of the choice option is the specific energy costs when harvesting and transporting crop of cereals (the objective function of the mathematical model), provided that they are minimized. Factors that determine these costs are identified and calculated dependencies are developed for their determination. The comprehensive method of optimizing the technology for harvesting and transporting crop of cereals from farms growing crops with the participation of road transport was further developed.","","978-1-6654-2366-3","10.1109/MEES52427.2021.9598768","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9598768","energetic criterion;model;optimization;Microsoft Excel;Solver;harvesting;transportation;combine;car-dump truck;energy costs","Productivity;Costs;Roads;Crops;Transportation;Tools;Mathematical models","aggregates (materials);agricultural machinery;agriculture;automobiles;costing;crops;goods distribution;industrial economics;linear programming;logistics;storage;transportation","automobile transport;energetic criterion;road transport;economic modeling;mathematical modeling;transport complex;linear mathematical programming;mowed cereals;aggregates;total productivity;forage harvesters;transport units;grain harvesting;transport group;storage complex;deterministic model;transportation;optimization mathematical model;transport service;logistics component;agricultural production;crop harvesting;crop transporting;tractor carts;cars;minimum energy costs;working cycles;green mass transportation","","4","","19","IEEE","16 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Previous methods either require large-scale manually-annotated data or rely on distant supervision approaches which suffer from the long-tail problem. To reduce the expensive manually-annotating cost and solve the long-tail problem, prototypical networks are widely used in few-shot RC tasks. Despite their remarkable performance, current prototypical networks ignore the different granularities of relations, which degrades the classification performance dramatically. Moreover, the optimization of current prototypical networks simply relies on the cross-entropy loss, which cannot consider the intra-relation compactness and the dispersion among relations in a semantic space. It is not robust enough for the current prototypical network in real-world and complicated scenarios. In this paper, we propose an area prototypical network with a granularity-aware measurement, aiming to consider the different granularities of relations. Each relation is represented as an area whose width can reflect the granularity level of relation. Moreover, to improve the robustness, bimargin loss is designed to force area prototypical network to improve the intra-relation compactness and inter-relation dispersion for the feature representation in a semantic space.

The current practice employed is manual coding, usually carried out by trained medical coders, making the process subjective, error-prone, inexact, and time-consuming. To alleviate this cost-intensive process, intelligent coding systems built on patients' structured electronic medical records are critical. Classification of medical diagnostic codes, like ICD-10, is widely employed to categorize patients' clinical conditions and associated diagnoses. In this work, we present a neural model $\mathcal{LATA}$, built on Label Attention Transformer Architectures for automatic assignment of ICD-10 codes.

Existing distributed methods are inefficient in communication. They have to shuffle partial matching results during the distributed multiway join. The partial matching results may be much larger than the data graph itself. To overcome the drawback, we develop the Batch-BENU framework for distributed subgraph enumeration on static data graphs. Batch-BENU executes a group of local search tasks in parallel. Each task enumerates subgraphs around a vertex in the data graph, guided by a backtracking-based execution plan. To handle large-scale data graphs that may exceed the memory capacity of a single machine, Batch-BENU stores the data graph in a distributed database. Each task queries adjacency sets of the data graph on demand, shuffling the data graph instead of partial matching results. To support incremental subgraph enumeration on dynamic data graphs, we propose the Streaming-BENU framework. Streaming-BENU turns the problem of enumerating incremental matching results into enumerating all matching results of incremental pattern graphs at each time step. We implement Batch-BENU and Streaming-BENU with the local database cache and the load balance optimization to improve their efficiency. Extensive experiments show that Batch-BENU and Streaming-BENU can scale to big graphs and complex pattern graphs. They outperform the state-of-the-art distributed methods by up to one and two orders of magnitude, respectively.","1558-2183","","10.1109/TPDS.2021.3076246","National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2019YFC1711000); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:U1811461,62072230); Jiangsu Province Science and Technology Research Program(grant numbers:BE2017155); Collaborative Innovation Center of Novel Software Technology and Industrialization, Jiangsu; Alibaba Innovative Resarch Project; Nanjing University; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9417730","Backtracking-based framework;distributed graph querying;incremental subgraph matching;subgraph isomorphism;subgraph matching","Distributed databases;Pattern matching;Graph theory;Big Data;Software algorithms;Optimization;Distributed computing","backtracking;computational complexity;data mining;distributed databases;graph theory;optimisation;query processing","incremental pattern graphs;Batch-BENU;Streaming-BENU;complex pattern graphs;towards efficient distributed subgraph enumeration;given pattern graph;data graph;graph analytic applications;partial matching results;static data graphs;large-scale data graphs;incremental subgraph enumeration;dynamic data graphs","","","","39","IEEE","28 Apr 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

For the trade-off between time and performance, most of methods use the coarse-to-fine hierarchical architecture, which consists of retrieving top-N candidates using global features, and re-ranking top-N with local features. However, since the two types of features are usually processed independently, re-ranking may harm global retrieval, termed re-ranking confusion. Moreover, re-ranking is limited by global retrieval. In this paper, we propose a tightly coupled learning (TCL) strategy to train triplet models. Different from original triplet learning (OTL) strategy, it combines global and local descriptors for joint optimization. In addition, a bidirectional search dynamic time warping (BS-DTW) algorithm is also proposed to mine locally spatial information tailored to VPR in re-ranking. The experimental results on public benchmarks show that the models using TCL outperform the models using OTL, and TCL can be used as a general strategy to improve performance for weakly supervised ranking tasks.

Although machine learning for decision making has been identified as one of the most important applications of AI, up to now, prescriptive analytics is mainly addressed with domain-specific optimization models. On the other hand, existing literature lacks generalized prescriptive analytics models capable of being dynamically adapted according to the human preferences. Reinforcement Learning, as the third machine learning paradigm alongside supervised learning and unsupervised learning, has the potential to deal with the dynamic, uncertain and time-variant environments, the huge states space of sequential decision making processes, as well as the incomplete knowledge.

Actually, this assumption is difficult to hold in many real engineering scenarios, where fault data cannot be obtained in advance. Therefore, how to mine universal and effective diagnosis knowledge only from the source domain and generalize it to unseen target tasks is crucial for further developing intelligent cross-domain fault diagnosis. With this in mind, this article proposes a novel domain transferability-based deep domain generalization (DT-DDG) method. To achieve excellent diagnostic performance on the unseen domain, an adversarial training scheme combining the dynamic weighting strategy and a batch spectral penalization regularization term is elaborated so that the domain-invariant and discriminative features can be extracted from multiple source domains with potential discrepancies, which can hold in new target domain without assuming the available of fault data. Moreover, the network architecture is further optimized to address the category shift problem, thus taking full advantage of more source domains and learn more abundant diagnosis knowledge. On multiple generalization tasks using five datasets, the effectiveness and superiority of the DT-DDG method are validated, and the results show its great promise in actual fault diagnosis scenarios.","1941-0050","","10.1109/TII.2022.3210555","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:51875100,52005267); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(grant numbers:3203002101C3); Jiangsu Planned Projects for Postdoctoral Research Funds(grant numbers:2020Z285); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9905947","Adversarial training;deep domain generalization;fault transfer diagnosis;rotating machinery;unseen target domain","Training;Fault diagnosis;Task analysis;Machinery;Feature extraction;Data models;Informatics","deep learning (artificial intelligence);fault diagnosis;feature extraction;learning (artificial intelligence);vibrational signal processing","abundant diagnosis knowledge;actual fault diagnosis scenarios;cross-domain fault diagnosis problems;developing intelligent cross-domain fault diagnosis;domain adaptation process;domain transferability-based deep domain generalization method;domain-invariant;DT-DDG method;effective diagnosis knowledge;fault data;knowledge transfer strategies;multiple generalization tasks;multiple source domains;source domain;target domain;universal diagnosis knowledge;unseen domain;unseen target tasks","","","","32","IEEE","29 Sep 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This paper combines the “OBE” concept with various learning models that are currently popular. The platform can be used for teaching without the need for teachers to design teaching programs and change the way teachers teach and learn. The adaptive learning platform can dynamically adjust the learning program, content and resources according to the actual situation and learning of the students, and the students can exit the system interface at any time after completing their assigned learning tasks and continue learning after self-modification of the current learning content. This platform enables students to learn each knowledge area more independently by dynamically adjusting the management of classroom progress and course schedule through independent selection of learning content, adjustment of learning time and learning plan. At the same time, teachers can use the platform to provide personalized guidance and supervision, as well as comparative analysis and summary of learning results.","","978-1-6654-5637-1","10.1109/ICKECS56523.2022.10060398","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10060398","cloud computing;OBE teaching;adaptive learning;learning platform design","Computers;Cloud computing;Adaptive learning;Adaptation models;Schedules;Computational modeling;Time measurement","cloud computing;computer aided instruction;educational courses;educational institutions;teaching","adaptive learning platform;assigned learning tasks;cloud computing;learning content;learning models;learning plan;learning program;learning results;OBE teaching mode;teaching programs;traditional teaching process","","","","14","IEEE","17 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we leverage the power of crowdsourcing by designing a set of Human Intelligence Tasks, or HITs in short, to ask a crowd to improve the quality of uncertain data. In particular, we consider crowds consists of workers with diverse accuracy rates when answering the HITs. We design solutions to maximize the data quality with minimal number of HITs. There are two obstacles for this non-trivial optimization, which lead to very high computational cost for selecting the optimal set of HITs. First, members of a crowd may return incorrect answers with different probabilities. Second, the HITs decomposed from uncertain data are often correlated. We have addressed these challenges in this paper by designing an effective approximation algorithm and an efficient heuristic solution, especially for crowds with diverse individual accuracy rates. To further improve the efficiency, we derive tight lower and upper bounds for effective filtering and estimation.

First, we use the fully attentional pyramid module (FAPM) to enhance the deep feature information of the original image. And we introduce the dense feature fusion module (DFFM) to fully fuse the bitemporal features to obtain the change regions. Second, the introduction of channelwise cross fusion transformer (CCT) and channelwise cross attention (CCA) not only can effectively fuse channel features focusing on different semantic patterns but also bridge the semantic gap between multiscale features. Next, we use the transformer decoder to map the learned high-level semantic information into the pixel space to refine the original features. In addition, we use the context extraction module (CEM) to obtain the local and global associations of feature maps.

To our knowledge graph mining techniques for enhancing learning in neural networks have not been thoroughly investigated. In this paper we propose an adapted version of the k-core structure for the complete weighted multipartite graph extracted from a deep learning architecture. As a multipartite graph is a combination of bipartite graphs, that are in turn the incidence graphs of hypergraphs, we design k-hypercore decomposition, the hypergraph analogue of k-core degeneracy. We applied k-hypercore to several neural network architectures, more specifically to convolutional neural networks and multilayer perceptrons for image recognition tasks after a very short pretraining. Then we used the information provided by the hypercore numbers of the neurons to re-initialize the weights of the neural network, thus biasing the gradient optimization scheme. Extensive experiments proved that k-hypercore outperforms the state-of-the-art initialization methods.","1051-4651","978-1-7281-8808-9","10.1109/ICPR48806.2021.9412940","NVIDIA; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9412940","","Deep learning;Knowledge engineering;Image recognition;Neurons;Tools;Multilayer perceptrons;Data mining","deep learning (artificial intelligence);feature extraction;gradient methods;image recognition;multilayer perceptrons;semantic networks","neural network initialization;machine learning tasks;complete weighted multipartite graph;deep learning architecture;bipartite graphs;neural network architectures;convolutional neural networks;image recognition task;multilayer perceptrons;knowledge graph mining techniques;gradient optimization scheme","","","","17","IEEE","5 May 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Consequently, efforts are underway to increase automation in HDMMs for increased productivity and safety, eventually transitioning to operator-less autonomous HDMMs to address skilled labor shortages. However, HDMMs are complex machines requiring continuous physical and cognitive inputs from human operators. Thus, developing autonomous HDMMs is a huge challenge, with current research and developments fragmented into several independent research domains. Furthermore, autonomous HDMM technologies are a stack of several technologies requiring a convergence of diverse competencies from the different domains. Through this study, we provide an overview of the HDMM industry and use the bounded rationality concept to propose multidisciplinary collaborations for new developments in autonomous HDMMs. Furthermore, we apply the transaction cost economics framework to highlight the conceptual challenges and implications of these collaborations. Therefore, we bring together several domains of the HDMM industry to introduce autonomous HDMMs as a general and unified approach. The collaborative challenges and potentials are mapped out between the following topics: mechanical systems, AI methods, software systems, sensors, connectivity, simulations and process optimization, business cases, organization theories, and finally, regulatory frameworks. In doing so, we highlight the need for new and multidisciplinary perspectives that should be considered by academic and industrial practitioners working on the development and deployment of autonomous HDMMs.","","978-1-6654-3895-7","10.1109/ICTE51655.2021.9584498","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9584498","automation;augmentation;autonomous;collaboration;mobile machinery;transaction cost economics","Industries;Productivity;Costs;Collaboration;Organizations;Software systems;Sensor systems","artificial intelligence;costing;industrial economics;labour resources;machinery production industries;mobile robots;organisational aspects;productivity;safety;sensors;vehicles","skilled labor shortages;HDMM industry;autonomous heavy-duty mobile machinery;multidisciplinary collaborative challenge;heavy-duty mobile machines;poor safety records;harsh work environment;productivity;transaction cost economics;mechanical systems;AI methods;software systems;sensors;process optimization;business cases;organization theory;independent research domain","","2","","42","IEEE","29 Oct 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It is mainly used to focus on the changing information on the ground over a period of time, and to identify the interested change targets from it. The rapid changes in ground information due to social development undoubtedly increase the importance of change detection. Currently, change detection methods still have some shortcomings in dealing with complex targets, environmental noise, and other aspects. Therefore, we propose a differential feature extraction network based on adaptive frequency transformer for remote sensing change detection (DAFT). Adaptive frequency transformer (AFFormer) is capable of separating change targets and environments from a frequency perspective and capturing long-range dependencies between feature information through self-attention. Therefore, in DAFT, we use AFFormer as the backbone network to extract feature information from bitemporal images, enhancing our focus on change targets while obtaining richer and more detailed information. To our knowledge, this is the first time that AFFormer has been applied in the field of CD. To address the issues of missing location information of change targets and insufficient local feature correlation, DAFT proposes a differential features enhancement module in the feature reconstruction stage of change targets. In addition, DAFT uses DO-Conv to enhance pixel correlation calculation in convolutional operations, allowing the network to focus on richer information. By outputting results at different scales during the feature reconstruction stage, DAFT computes multiple losses that are summed up to guide the training process for better performance. The experimental results prove that DAFT achieves high versus mainstream networks.

Thus, it is difficult for them to make correct choices based on their skills. Generally, existing methods mainly mine isomorphic information, ignoring relationships among heterogeneous information. Therefore, this paper proposes a new framework to give freshmen appropriate recommendations by mining heterogeneous educational information. This framework is composed of five stages: after data preprocessing, a weighted heterogeneous educational network (WHEN) is constructed according to heterogeneous information in student historical data. Then, the WHEN is projected into different subnets, on which metapaths are defined. Next, a WHEN-based embedding method is proposed, which helps mine the weighted heterogeneous information on multiple extended metapaths. Finally, with the information mined, a matrix factorization algorithm is used to recommend learning resources and majors for freshmen. A large number of experimental results show that the proposed framework can achieve better results than other baseline methods. This indicates that the proposed method is effective and can provide great help to freshmen during the COVID-19 storm.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3075675","Major projects of the National Social Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:19ZDA066); New Agricultural and New Engineering Research and Reform Practice Commission Project(grant numbers:2020A1704); Humanity and Social Science Youth Foundation of Ministry of Education of China(grant numbers:20YJC860040); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, Zhongnan University of Economics and Law(grant numbers:2722019PY062); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, Zhongnan University of Economics and Law(grant numbers:2722020JCT034); Application Foundation Frontier Project of Wuhan Science and Technology Bureau in 2020(grant numbers:2020010601012183); Humanities and Social Sciences Planning Project of the China Ministry of Education(grant numbers:19YJAZH099); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, Zhongnan University of Economics and Law(grant numbers:2722021BX025); Hundred years and hundreds items of grassroots party building innovation projects, Zhongnan University of Economics and Law; New Engineering Research and Practice Project of Ministry of Education of China(grant numbers:E-JSJRJ20201330); Ministry of Education’s Collaborative Education Project of Industry University Cooperation; National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:72041005); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9416497","COVID-19;weighted heterogeneous educational network (WHEN);freshman;recommendation;random walk","Data mining;COVID-19;Training;Social networking (online);Task analysis;Collaboration","computer aided instruction;data mining;further education;learning (artificial intelligence);matrix decomposition;recommender systems","weighted heterogeneous information;student historical data;data preprocessing;heterogeneous educational information;freshmen appropriate recommendations;isomorphic information;correct choices;traditional higher education;unprecedented challenges;global explosion;COVID-19 storm;personalized freshmen recommendation;weighted heterogeneous educational network embedding","","3","","45","CCBY","26 Apr 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

That’s why there’s been a rise in the demand for edge cloud computing power from endpoint gadgets. Due to its adaptability and proximity to the user, an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) may be used to support mobile edge computing (MEC) via job offloading, potentially relieving strain on edge clouds. Due to limitations in processing power and battery life, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) devices face a huge issue with the rise of Applications and services for mobile devices that can't afford to be delayed and that need a lot of processing power. Task offloading is one way that mobile cloud computing may help you get around these restrictions. The biggest difficulties with this paradigm, however, are the significant latency and security concerns. The edge-cloud computing model was then proposed and has since seen widespread adoption as a means of dealing with these complications. However, the present task offloading models allow UAVs to perform their heavy jobs at the linked edge server, leading to unnecessary loads owing to the huge amount of UAVs and, in turn, increasing the latency. For this reason, this study has presented a delay-optimal task offloading strategy for multi-tier edge-cloud computing with many users. In this research, a system model has been proposed to assist an intelligent and perceptive agent in determining the best computational offloading strategy, minimizing both the time it takes to complete a job and the amount of power it needs to do so. The efficacy of an agent was shown, and simulation results revealed that its adoption may greatly cut delay and energy usage.","","979-8-3503-4664-0","10.1109/ICEARS56392.2023.10085047","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10085047","UAV;Mobile Edge Computing;offloading;Edge computing;delay optimal","Cloud computing;Computational modeling;Autonomous aerial vehicles;Software;Numerical models;Delays;Servers","augmented reality;autonomous aerial vehicles;cloud computing;edge computing;Internet of Things;mobile computing;resource allocation","augmented reality;autonomous vehicles;computational offloading strategy;delay-optimal task offloading strategy;edge cloud;edge-cloud computing model;edge-cloud computing systems;endpoint gadgets;increasingly complex applications;job offloading;linked edge server;mobile cloud computing;mobile devices;mobile edge computing;mobile terminals;multitier edge-cloud computing;optimal work offloading;processing power;system model;task offloading models;UAV;unmanned aerial vehicle;Unmanned Aerial Vehicles capable;Unmanned Aerial Vehicles devices","","","","18","IEEE","5 Apr 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

For this purpose, we develop a framework, named Forecasting Unobserved Node States (FUNS), that allows forecasting the state at entirely unobserved locations based on spatio-temporal correlations and the graph inductive bias. FUNS serves as a blueprint for optimizing models only on observed data and demonstrates good generalization capabilities for predicting the state at entirely unobserved locations during the testing stage. Our framework can be combined with any spatio-temporal Graph Neural Network, that exploits spatio-temporal correlations with surrounding observed locations by using the network's graph structure. Our employed model builds on a previous model by also allowing us to exploit prior knowledge about locations of interest, e.g. the road type. Our empirical evaluation of both simulated and real-world datasets demonstrates that Graph Neural Networks are well-suited for this task.","2375-9259","979-8-3503-4609-1","10.1109/ICDMW58026.2022.00101","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10031042","graph neural networks;spatio-temporal;fore-casting;imputation","Correlation;Weather forecasting;Predictive models;Graph neural networks;Sensors;Task analysis;Forecasting","graph neural networks;graph theory;learning (artificial intelligence);spatiotemporal phenomena","complete spatial coverage;entirely unobserved locations;future states;graph inductive bias;Graph Neural Networks;named Forecasting Unobserved Node States;observed locations;solving tasks;spatial locations;spatio-temporal correlations;spatio-temporal data processing;spatio-temporal Graph Neural Network","","","","58","IEEE","8 Feb 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Machine learning provides a promising technique to optimize EEG patterns toward better decoding accuracy. However, existing algorithms do not effectively explore the underlying data structure capturing the true EEG sample distribution and, hence, can only yield a suboptimal decoding accuracy. To uncover the intrinsic distribution structure of EEG data, we propose a clustering-based multitask feature learning algorithm for improved EEG pattern decoding. Specifically, we perform affinity propagation-based clustering to explore the subclasses (i.e., clusters) in each of the original classes and then assign each subclass a unique label based on a one-versus-all encoding strategy. With the encoded label matrix, we devise a novel multitask learning algorithm by exploiting the subclass relationship to jointly optimize the EEG pattern features from the uncovered subclasses. We then train a linear support vector machine with the optimized features for EEG pattern decoding. Extensive experimental studies are conducted on three EEG data sets to validate the effectiveness of our algorithm in comparison with other state-of-the-art approaches. The improved experimental results demonstrate the outstanding superiority of our algorithm, suggesting its prominent performance for EEG pattern decoding in BCI applications.","2162-2388","","10.1109/TNNLS.2021.3053576","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9349966","Brain–computer interface (BCI);electroencephalogram (EEG);multitask learning;pattern decoding;subclass regularization","Electroencephalography;Decoding;Feature extraction;Task analysis;Optimization;Data mining;Sparse matrices","brain-computer interfaces;electroencephalography;learning (artificial intelligence);medical signal processing;pattern classification;pattern clustering;support vector machines","EEG decoding;accurate electroencephalogram pattern;specific mental tasks;brain-computer interface;considerably low signal-to-noise ratio;brain scalp;machine learning;EEG patterns;underlying data structure;sample distribution;suboptimal decoding accuracy;intrinsic distribution structure;EEG data;clustering-based multitask feature learning algorithm;improved EEG pattern decoding;affinity propagation-based;encoded label matrix;novel multitask learning algorithm;subclass relationship;pattern features;uncovered subclasses;linear support vector machine;optimized features;data sets","Brain-Computer Interfaces;Cluster Analysis;Electroencephalography;Machine Learning;Neural Networks, Computer","10","","77","IEEE","8 Feb 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, researchers find it relatively challenging to recognize and categorize their favorite research articles. Though this task can be achieved by putting in the human work, it would be tedious and exhaustively time-consuming. Henceforth, much research has been done in the field of topic modelling to yield accurate results with a good computation time. The main objective of this paper is to compare the two distinct yet vastly used topic modelling approaches for research paper classification, which can further group the research papers into their respective classes. The two chosen topic modeling methodologies are Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) and Latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA). This paper introduces a comparison between LDA model's performance with a relatively efficient generative model (NMF) and analyzes its performance on the dataset that consists of 1740 papers extracted from the NYC university website. In comparison, the average coherence score for the LDA method was 0.5282, with its optimal choice of topics being 22, which was slightly higher than the NMF model as it yielded a coherence score of 0.4937 with its optimal topics being 9. To enhance the categorization of LDA, clustering the optimal topics of LDA from 22 to 10 using pyLDAvis has been done. On closely comparing both the models, LDA performs slightly better than NMF with a higher confidence score.","","978-1-6654-5342-4","10.1109/NKCon56289.2022.10127059","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10127059","Coherence score;LDA;NMF;research article categorization;Topic modeling","Analytical models;Computational modeling;Coherence;Resource management;Task analysis","data mining;matrix decomposition;natural language processing;sentiment analysis;text analysis","chosen topic modeling methodologies;comparative analysis;distinct yet vastly used topic;easier identification;exhaustively time-consuming;favorite research articles;good computation time;LDA model;NMF approaches;NMF model;optimal topics;relatively efficient generative model;research paper classification;research papers categorization;respective categories","","","","20","IEEE","26 May 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To meet such requirements, researchers proposed a new paradigm, i.e., edge computing. Edge computing consists of distributed computational resources and enables the execution of IoT applications closer to the edge of the network. However, the distributed nature of this paradigm makes the application deployment and development process more challenging since the developer must divide the application’s functionality into multiple parts, assigning for each a set of requirements. As a result, the developer must: 1) define the application’s requirements and validate them at design time and 2) find a deployment strategy on the target edge computing platform. In this article, we propose EdgeFlow, a new IoT framework capable of assisting the developer in the application development process. Specifically, we introduce a methodology for latency-sensitive IoT applications development and deployment, consisting of three different stages, i.e., the development, validation, and deployment. To this end, we propose an extension of the flow-based programming paradigm with new timing requirements and provide a resource allocation technique to assist with the deployment and validation of latency-sensitive IoT applications. Finally, we evaluate EdgeFlow by: 1) presenting the application development methodology and 2) performing a quantitative evaluation demonstrating our resource allocation technique’s capabilities to find feasible and optimal deployment strategies.

To mitigate this problem, we propose a heterogeneous aspect graph neural network (HAGNN) to learn the structure and semantic knowledge from intersentence relationships. Our model is a heterogeneous graph neural network since it contains three different kinds of nodes: word nodes, aspect nodes, and sentence nodes.

In particular, self-reported satisfaction survey and the associated patient electronic health records play an important role in the hospital-patient interaction analysis.

However, Bitcoin’s erratic behavior has discouraged some potential investors. To get insights into its behavior and price fluctuation, past studies have discovered the correlation between Twitter sentiments and Bitcoin behavior. Most of them have exclusively focused on their relationships, instead of the Twitter sentiment analysis itself. Finding the most suitable classification algorithms for sentiment analysis for this kind of data is challenging. For the enormous data in Twitter, the supervised sentiment analysis approach of unlabeled data can be time-consuming and expensive, which has been studied to be superior to unsupervised ones. As such, we propose the HyVADRF (hybrid valence aware dictionary and sentiment reasoner (VADER)–random forest) and gray wolf optimizer (GWO) model. A semantic and rule-based VADER was used to calculate polarity scores and classify sentiments, which overcame the weakness of manual labeling, while a random forest was utilized as its supervised classifier. Furthermore, considering Twitter’s massive size, we collected over 3.6 million tweets and analyzed various dataset sizes as these are related to the model’s learning process. Lastly, GWO parameter tuning was conducted to optimize the classifier’s performance. The results show that 1) the HyVADRF model had an accuracy of 75.29%, precision of 70.22%, recall of 87.70%, and F1-score of 78%. 2) The most ideal dataset size percentage is 90% of the total collected tweets ( $n =1$ ,249,060). 3) The standard deviations are 0.0008 for accuracy and F1-score and 0.0011 for precision and recall.

This is a complex process that requires coordination among all parties. It can be divided into three main stages: planning, implementation and monitoring. The purpose of this study is to determine the best mode of resource selection in collaborative logistics using genetic algorithms. The first stage of collaborative logistics is planning, including determining customer needs, defining inventory levels, and determining transportation routes. This is a complex process because it involves many different types of resources and products. In this paper, we will discuss how to use genetic algorithms to improve collaborative logistics. When improving the collaborative logistics process, the first thing to consider is to determine all necessary resources and products required for such supply chain management. This will help eliminate unnecessary costs, because only those items that are really needed will be purchased from suppliers. This paper analyzes the framework of collaborative logistics mechanism, uses analytic hierarchy process (AHP) to preliminarily screen logistics resources to obtain the candidate resource pool required by the collaborative system, and proposes an effective resource selection process using the improved contract network protocol method based on the collaborative logistics network model. The negotiation process determines the basic rates for transportation, warehousing, and other items in the collaborative logistics system, and achieves the aggregation and collaboration of logistics tasks through solving the collaborative logistics network model. Finally, the fuzzy comprehensive evaluation method is used to calculate the allocation proportion of additional profits in the collaborative system.","","979-8-3503-4745-6","10.1109/ICDCECE57866.2023.10150578","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10150578","Genetic algorithm;supply chain management;Collaborative logistics","Supply chain management;Protocols;Warehousing;Collaboration;Transportation;Planning;Task analysis","","","","","","20","IEEE","21 Jun 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The role of data in the processing and analysis of neurological features is critical, and the main goal is to efficiently extract neurological features from cancer patients' data. Random extraction of neurological features from cancer patient data is a new research initiative. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) is a promising approach in various healthcare applications to efficiently perform the data processing tasks. Some CNN-based approaches have been proposed to perform efficient cancer disease prediction using remotely sensed neurological features. Cancer disease extraction based on MPDCNN is one of the best CNN approaches used for extracting features and perform disease prediction from Geo-Fan-2 (GF-2) sensing cancer patient data. However, due to its sparse arrangement of optimal boundary, exact neurological features and high amount of training time, it is insufficient to investigate and automate the neurological feature extraction process from the cancer patient's data. A Novel Optimized Multi Feature Contour based Hierarchical Neural Network (NOMFCHNN) is proposed to improve the automatic neurological feature prediction process. NOMFCHNN is made up of expanding neural network features and layers related to inception, which contains the data about network localization, and this approach uses optimal and exact neurological feature matching with extended feature extraction. This method also employs contour map optimization to identify contours based on globalization of cancer patient data along with the output of the identified contour being transmitted to the next identified contour in the selected hierarchical region. Furthermore, the proposed approach evaluates the low- resolution term in cancer patient's data to gain knowledge from the cancer patient's data by obtaining the prediction results of neighbouring optimal and exact neurological features to eliminate small changes or errors. A multi scale feature Prediction module is used to eliminate feature inconsistency between the encoding and decoding phases of the prediction process in order to identify better contours of neurological features from remote sensing cancer patient's data. Extensive experiments on combined repository cancer patient data show that the proposed methodology improves the prediction accuracy and other parameters when compared to the other state-of-the-art methods used to remotely analyze the neurological features.","","978-1-6654-7451-1","10.1109/IDCIoT56793.2023.10053483","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10053483","Cancer Patient’s Data Prediction;Contour Map Optimization;Remote Sensing;Neurological Features;Convolution Neural Networks;Multi Scale Feature Extraction;Neurological Feature Resolution","Location awareness;Semantics;Feature extraction;Sensors;Data mining;Object recognition;Convolutional neural networks","cancer;convolutional neural nets;feature extraction;medical image processing;neurophysiology;remote sensing","automatic neurological feature prediction process;cancer disease extraction;cancer patient neurological features;cancer prediction;combined repository cancer patient data;convolutional neural networks;Geo-Fan-2 sensing cancer patient data;multiscale feature prediction module;neural network features;neurological feature extraction process;NOMFCHNN;optimized counter based hierarchical model;optimized multifeature contour;remote sensing cancer patient;remotely sensed neurological features","","","","20","IEEE","1 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Then, an embedding aggregation module (EAM) is proposed to obtain high-quality aggregated embedding in temporal. Finally, the temporal embedding combined with the preliminary embedding extracted from the current frame to obtain a refined embedding feature for subsequent position prediction and association. Importantly, we achieve a beneficial interaction between embedding extraction, position prediction and association task. The proposed method does not suffer from significant memory consumption. Therefore, our method is a potential solution for intelligent video analysis on IoT devices.

Forecasts depend on different contextual variables that generally have a spatial component, a temporal component, or both. We study the sensitivity of the spatiotemporal features of machine learning forecast models. Our main goal is to understand how the spatiotemporal features affect the performance of the models.

Sensing-data-driven IoT applications are prevalent in IoT systems, and their task processing relies on sensing data from sensors. Therefore, to ensure the Quality of Service (QoS) of such applications in an edge-enabled IoT system, dedicated caching functions (CFs) are required to cache necessary sensing data. This article considers an edge-enabled IoT system and investigates the joint caching and computing service placement (JCCSP) problem for sensing-data-driven IoT applications. Then, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is exploited to address the problem since it can adapt to a heterogeneous system with limited prior knowledge. In the proposed DRL-based approaches, a policy network based on the encoder–decoder model is constructed to address the issue of varying sizes of JCCSP states and actions caused by different numbers of CFs related to applications. Then, an on-policy REINFORCE-based method is adopted to train the policy network. After that an off-policy training method based on the twin-delayed (TD) deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) is proposed to enhance the training efficiency and experience utilization. In the proposed DDPG-based method, a weight-averaged twin- $Q$ -delayed (WATQD) algorithm is introduced to reduce the bias of  $Q$ -value estimation. Simulation results show that our proposed DRL-based JCCSP approaches can achieve converged performance that is significantly superior to benchmarks.

In addition, existing frontier-based exploration strategies are mostly designed for occupancy grid maps, thus failing to use surface information of obstacles in complex three-dimensional scenes. To address these limitations, we utilize Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) as the map form for both mapping and exploration. We extend our previous mapping work to exploration setting by introducing MR-GMMExplore, a Multi-Robot GMM-based Exploration system in which robots transfer GMM submaps to reduce data transmission and perform exploration directly using the generated GMM map. Specifically, we propose a GMM spatial information extraction strategy that efficiently extracts obstacle probability information from GMM submaps. Then we present a goal selection method that allows robots to explore different areas, and a GMM-based local planner that realizes local planning using GMM maps instead of converting them into grid maps. Simulation results show that the transmission of GMM submaps reduces approximately 96% communication load compared with point clouds and our mean-based extraction strategy is 4 times faster than the traversal-based one.

However, security of IoT devices and data is a major concern. This research work prioritizes the alternatives of security authentication features from studied articles. The multi-objective optimization method based on the ratio analysis (MOORA) is useful in multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) for ranking the alternatives. The statistical aggregation (SA) method has been used to assign weights to security authentication features in comparison to entropy method. In this paper, we identify weights for authentication features using the proposed SA method. Moreover, we evaluate the accuracy rates of the proposed model using entropy method. Finally, we ranked out the alternatives of authentication features using the MOORA approach. In fact, the entropy weight values came against the initial value of the objects in which the accuracy was 15% which is not suitable to this problem while the accuracy of the SA is 85%. Hence, the accuracy improvement is approximately 70 % using the SA method. This method is applicable for finding the weights of the objects based on initial values by MCDM approaches.

Instead, the results of accredited performance measurements are used to measure these standards, which are further used as references in the capacity measuring methods employed by industries. Generally, in industries, the capacity of a web application server is defined by OPS, for which no clear transition criterion exists for calculating tpmC using an empirical verification method. Considering secure Unix to Linux (U2L) x86-based server migration, there are no methods to compare and verify the max-jOPS value of Standard Performance Evaluation Corp., which is an industry-recognized performance measurement standard, to the Unix-based benchmark tpmC. In this study, a scenario-based U2L migration was empirically verified by analyzing and comparing pre-to-post with the interpretation of a census statistical system log data, which was conducted on approximately 1.7M households over 21 days with 25,288 maximum concurrent users. We present the correlation through pre-to-post comparison and analysis of U2L for each census statistical system log data by measuring the maximum CPU utilization as U2L migration between heterogeneous CPUs. The correlation is applied to OPS using the tpmC value of TPC-C proportional equation and quantified as a derived conversion ratio of OPS to max-jOPS. Consequently, we formulated and normalized an arithmetic expression, resulting in a CPU core conversion ratio of 0.165 as facile from a Unix-based legacy platform to an x86-based server. Therefore, we propose a new server sizing model for secure U2L migration between heterogeneous CPU architectures, which results in an average of 14.3% improvement in data processing time.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3119397","MSIP (Ministry of Science, ICT, and Future Planning), Korea, under the Human Resource Development Project for Brain Scouting Program and Research on Security of 5G-data-intensive Computing Platforms Based on Disaggregated Architecture(grant numbers:IITP-2017-0-01889,IITP-2020-0-00666); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9567673","Server sizing;capacity planning;Unix to Linux (U2L) migration","Servers;Business;Size measurement;Hardware;Standards;Java;Benchmark testing","Internet;Linux;microprocessor chips;performance evaluation;statistical analysis","quantitative server sizing model;performance satisfaction;OPS;server hardware;accredited performance measurements;Web application server;clear transition criterion;empirical verification method;Linux x86-based server migration;max-jOPS value;industry-recognized performance measurement standard;Unix-based benchmark tpmC;scenario-based U2L migration;census statistical system;pre-to-post comparison;maximum CPU utilization;Unix-based legacy platform;operation per second;microprocessors;capacity measuring methods;standard performance evaluation corp;census statistical system log data;heterogeneous CPUs;arithmetic expression;TPC-C proportional equation","","","","36","CCBYNCND","11 Oct 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Energy is a specific commodity that distinguishes it from other types of commodities, namely: the impossibility of efficiently storing energy in large volumes; the impersonality of energy as a commodity, since all electricity is supplied to the general network; impossibility of energy rejection; energy demand is constant. For factor analysis, the principal component method was applied, which made it possible to reduce the dimension of the factor space and carry out its structuring and interpretation in the form of control factors.

Recently, presentation-based approaches have been widely concerned and many feature extraction algorithms based on this have been proposed. However, in the process of acquiring real data, the pollution of complex noise cannot always be avoided, which will greatly increase the difficulty of feature extraction and even lead to failed feature extraction results. Thus, a robust image feature extraction model based on Orthogonal Low-Rank Projection Learning (OLRPL) is proposed, in which the introduction of orthogonal matrix can encourage the preservation of the main components of the sample. Particularly, the row sparsity constraint introduced on the projection matrix can encourage the features to be more compact, discriminative and interpretable. In particular, the Weighted Truncated Schatten p-norm (WTSN) is proposed to better solve the optimization problem of low-rank constraints. At the same time, the correntropy is applied in OLRPL to suppress the complex noise in the data and thus improve the robustness of the model. Finally, we specially design a robust classification loss function so that our model can be fitted the supervised scene effectively.

Besides, the resulting configuration is specific to the network where the system is deployed or the type of attacks to detect.

However, there exist two drawbacks: firstly, these methods are mostly designed for vectorial data in Euclidean spaces, which are not suitable for multidimensional data with nonlinear manifold structure, e.g., videos and image-sets. Secondly, the clustering performance heavily relies on the quality of a pre-learned Laplacian matrix in which the global structure may be mis-interpreted without considering manifold structures. In this paper, we firstly provide a unified framework about self-expression learning on Grassmann manifolds, which implements the clustering tasks for multidimensional data under subspace views. Then, to assign optimal neighbors to each data depending on the local distance, we adaptively learn the neighborhood relationship from the obtained self-expression coefficient matrix, referred to Learning Adaptive Neighborhood Graph on Grassmann manifolds (GMAN). In the optimization process, the neighborhood relationship can be adaptively learned and updated with the coefficient matrix. The experimental results on five public datasets show that the proposed method is obviously better than many related clustering methods based on Grassmann manifolds, proving the effectiveness of GMAN in multidimensional data clustering.","1941-0077","","10.1109/TMM.2020.2975394","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:U19B2039,61906011,61632006,61772048,61672071,U1811463); Beijing Natural Science Foundation(grant numbers:4204086); Beijing Municipal Science and Technology Commission(grant numbers:KM202010005014,KM201910005028); Beijing Talents Fund(grant numbers:2017A24); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9005188","Subspace clustering;Grassmann manifolds;adaptive neighborhood regularization","Manifolds;Laplace equations;Learning systems;Videos;Clustering methods;Streaming media;Electronic mail","graph theory;image processing;learning (artificial intelligence);matrix algebra;pattern clustering;video signal processing","manifold structures;self-expression learning;Grassmann manifolds;neighborhood relationship;self-expression coefficient matrix;multidimensional data clustering;self-expression based spectral clustering;affinity matrix;Laplacian constraint;global structure;raw data;vectorial data;pre-learned Laplacian matrix;adaptive neighborhood graph learning;video/image-set subspace clustering","","14","","46","IEEE","20 Feb 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

For EA to succeed, the processes used to conceptualize, design, implement, manage, and change the EA also need to be effective. We refer to this collection of processes as “enterprise architecting”. Our data from qualitative interviews show that effective architecting is the result of well-coordinated EA activities. Our article investigates how two important types of coordination—explicit (i.e., behavioral) and implicit (i.e., cognitive) coordination influence architecting effectiveness. Our study found that implicit coordination is particularly important because it not only influences architecting effectiveness directly, but it also enhances the effects of explicit coordination. More specifically, shared schemas enhance the benefits of governance mechanisms (coordination by plan), whereas common ground enhances the benefits of communication (coordination by feedback). We also uncovered a “self-fueling” recursive effect in which architecting effectiveness further strengthens implicit coordination, generating a beneficial cycle of continual EA improvement.","1558-0040","","10.1109/TEM.2021.3109219","Kogods Center for Information Technology and the Global Economy; Singapore Ministry of Education Tier 1(grant numbers:RG66-19); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9560012","Architecting effectiveness;enterprise architecture (EA);implicit coordination","Task analysis;Organizations;Standards organizations;Stakeholders;Cognition;Interviews;Government","","","","1","","","IEEE","6 Oct 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

Specifically, during the training process, we produce the label distribution via the online manner to mine the relation information of different classes, thus it is beneficial for extracting the discriminative feature. Besides, for the label distribution of each class, we further revise it to give more and equal attention to the other domains that the class does not belong to, which can effectively reduce the domain gap across different domains and obtain the domain-invariant feature. Furthermore, we also give the theoretical analysis to demonstrate that the proposed method can effectively deal with the domain-shift issue.

Attentive training is based on the observation that, in the real world, multiple talkers very unlikely start speaking at the same time, and therefore, a deep neural network can be trained to create a representation of the first speaker and utilize it to attend to or track that speaker in a multitalker noisy mixture.

However, the coupling effects of system’s nonlinear and nonstationary characteristics often cause process consistent underlying information to be buried, allowing accurate extraction to be a significant challenge. This also complicates the development of BFIP fault diagnosis model. Therefore, we propose a novel data-driven joint fault diagnosis strategy that employs regularized mutual kernel analytic stationary subspace analysis (RMK-ASSA) and deep broad stationary kernel network (DBSKNet) to eliminate this interference. To develop this method, we first construct an RMK-ASSA approach to address the poor modeling accuracy caused by standard analytic stationary subspace analysis (ASSA)’s inability to handle complex process nonlinearity. Global and local kernels are utilized to account for multiple nonlinearities in BFIP data. The weight of different nonlinear data is calculated by regularized principal component analysis, and the main information is imported into ASSA to obtain more robust and accurate modeling results by eliminating the interference of redundant noise. Subsequently, we design a DBSKNet-based classifier to implement the fault diagnosis task. This network further considers the nonlinearity by boosting kernel structure in depth and width while distinguishing the respective contributions of different kernels to fault diagnosis results. Finally, a double-layer loop parameter optimization algorithm is used for optimizing. Simulated cases and practical BFIP tests validate that RMK-ASSA eliminates the negative impact caused by nonstationary data and that the proposed joint fault diagnosis strategy outperforms other methods. Note to Practitioners—BFIP’s nonlinear and nonstationary coupling properties pose unique challenges in eliminating distractions, constructing fault classifiers and accurately detecting process anomalies. To tackle these challenges, this paper proposes a joint fault diagnosis strategy based on RMK-ASSA and DBSKNet. RMK-ASSA effectively estimates nonlinear consistent features, while DBSKNet mines rich deep nonlinear information, accurately distinguishing variations in BFIP data under different working conditions. Experimental results demonstrate that this data-driven strategy can perform high-quality fault diagnosis, enabling field engineers to execute operations efficiently.","1558-3783","","10.1109/TASE.2023.3287578","Key Programme of the National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61933015); Central University Basic Research Fund of China (for New Generation Industrial Control System (NGICS) Platform, Zhejiang University)(grant numbers:K20200002); Social Development Project of Zhejiang Provincial Public Technology Research(grant numbers:LGF19F030004,LGG21F030015); Fundamental Research Funds of Zhejiang Sci-Tech University(grant numbers:2021Q024); Open Research Project of the State Key Laboratory of Industrial Control Technology, Zhejiang University, China(grant numbers:ICT2021B45); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10159592","Blast furnace iron-making process (BFIP);kernel learning;stationary subspace analysis;fault diagnosis","Kernel;Fault diagnosis;Blast furnaces;Iron;Support vector machines;Optimization;Couplings","","","","","","","IEEE","22 Jun 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

However, the existing multi-object trackers are commonly designed for natural scenes without considering the characteristics of remotely sensed data. In addition, most trackers are composed of two independent stages of detection and reidentification (ReID), which means that they cannot be mutually promoted. To this end, we propose an end-to-end online framework, which is called TGraM, for multi-object tracking in satellite videos. It models multi-object tracking as a graph information reasoning procedure from the multitask learning perspective. Specifically, a graph-based spatiotemporal reasoning module is presented to mine the potential high-order correlations between video frames. Furthermore, considering the inconsistency of optimization objectives between detection and ReID, a multitask gradient adversarial learning strategy is designed to regularize each task-specific network. In addition, aiming at the data scarcity in this field, a large-scale and high-resolution Jilin-1 satellite video dataset for multi-object tracking (AIR-MOT) is built for the experiments. Compared with state-of-the-art multi-object trackers, TGraM achieves efficient collaborative learning between detection and ReID, improving the tracking accuracy by 1.2 multiple object tracking accuracy.

However, most existing methods fail to explore the internal spatial structure of data, resulting in low unmixing performance. Moreover, when the algorithm is optimized, the solution is unstable. In this article, a regularizer based on nonlocal tensor similarity is proposed, which can not only fully preserve the global information of HSI but also mine the internal information of data in the spatial domain. HSI is regarded as a 3-D tensor and is directly subjected to endmember extraction and abundance estimation. To fully explore the structural characteristics of data, we simultaneously use the local smoothing and low tensor rank prior of the data to constrain the unmixing model. First, several 4-D tensor groups can be obtained after the nonlocal similarity structure of HSI is learned. Subsequently, a low tensor rank prior is applied to each 4-D tensor, which can fully simulate the nonlocal similarity in the image. In addition, total variation (TV) is also used to explore the local spatial relationship of data, which can generate a smooth abundance map through edge preservation. The optimization is solved by the ADMM algorithm. Experiments on synthetic and real data illustrate the superiority of the proposed method.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2021.3095488","National Key Research and Development Project(grant numbers:2020YFB2103902); National Science Fund for Distinguished Young Scholars(grant numbers:61825603); Key Program of National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61632018); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9511333","Hyperspectral unmixing;low tensor rank;nonlocal similarity;nonnegative tensor factorization (NTF)","Tensors;TV;Hyperspectral imaging;Data models;Task analysis;Optimization;Data mining","geophysical image processing;image representation;matrix decomposition;tensors","global information;HSI;internal information;spatial domain;3D tensor;structural characteristics;unmixing model;nonlocal similarity structure;local spatial relationship;hyperspectral unmixing;nonlocal similarity-regularized low-rank tensor factorization;nonnegative tensor factorization;tensor representation;hyperspectral imagery;information loss;internal spatial structure;low unmixing performance;nonlocal tensor similarity;4D tensor groups;ADMM algorithm","","5","","50","IEEE","11 Aug 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this paper, we propose a new task in this field. This task aims to pre-train a general encoder to extract any facial expression representations without fine-tuning. To tackle this task, we extend the self-supervised contrastive learning to pre-train a general encoder for facial expression analysis. To be specific, given a batch of facial expressions, some positive and negative pairs are firstly constructed based on coarse-grained labels and a FER-specified data augmentation strategy. Secondly, we propose the coarse-contrastive (CRS-CONT) learning, where the features of positive pairs are pulled together, while pushed away from the features of negative pairs. Moreover, one key event is that the excessive constraint on the coarse-grained feature distribution will affect fine-grained FER applications. To address this, a weight vector is designed to control the optimization of the CRS-CONT learning. As a result, a well-trained general encoder with frozen weights could preferably adapt to different facial expressions and realize the linear evaluation on any target datasets. Extensive experiments on both in- the-wild and in- the-lab FER datasets show that our method provides superior or comparable performance against state-of-the-art FER methods, especially on unseen facial expressions and cross-dataset evaluation. We hope that this work will help to reduce the training burden and develop a new solution against the fully-supervised feature learning with fine-grained labels.

This article investigates the transition at the end of a horizontal leader's assignment and the morphostatic or morphogenetic consequences for future assignments, stemming from the “fit” between the horizontal leader's work with the expectations that led to his/her appointment. A realist social theory and transition theory perspective is taken with 30 interviews in eight case companies. A model for transition in balanced leadership is abductively developed. Variables identified are context, conditions, actors, mechanism, criteria, and outcomes.

The core of GNN is the aggregation and combination functions, and mainstream GNN studies focus on the enhancement of these functions. However, GNNs face a common challenge, i.e., useless features contained in neighbor nodes may be integrated into the target node during the aggregation process. This leads to poor node embedding and undermines downstream tasks. To tackle this problem, this article proposes a novel GNN optimization framework GNN-MHSIC by introducing the nonparametric dependence method Hilbert-Schmidt independence criterion (HSIC) under the guidance of information bottleneck. HSIC is utilized to guide the information propagation among layers of a GNN from multiaspect views. GNN-MHSIC aims to achieve three main objectives: 1) minimizing the HSIC between the input features and the propagation layers; 2) maximizing the HSIC between the propagation layers and the ground truth; and 3) minimizing the HSIC between the propagation layers. With a multiaspect design, GNN-MHSIC can minimize the propagation of redundant information while preserving relevant information about the target node. We prove GNN-MHSIC's finite upper and lower bounds theoretically and evaluate it experimentally with four classic GNN models, including the graph convolutional network, the graph attention network (GAT), the heterogeneous GAT, and the heterogeneous graph (HG) propagation network on three widely used HGs.

In this paper, we propose a novel CAM-based framework with Multi-scale Low-Discriminative Feature Reactivation (mLDFR) for WSOL. The mLDFR framework reactivates the low-discriminative object parts via bottom-up continuous feature maps recalibration and multi-scale object category mapping. Compared with the AL-based methods, our method fully improves the localization power of the network without damaging the classification power and can perform multi-instance localization, which are hard to achieve under the AL-based framework. Moreover, the mLDFR framework is flexible, and can be built on the top of various classical CNN backbones. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our method.

While planning strategically to obtain academic excellence, there are various risks towards sustainable excellence in teaching, learning, and assessment, which if not managed, will negatively affect the performance.In Bahrain, public universities suffer from two major risks: financial risk, and mass education. Financially, students pay about 4% of the total tuition fee, where most of the university’s budget is subsidized by the government. Academically, mass education resulted in a vast increase in the student-to-faculty ratio, affecting the quality of teaching, learning, and assessment.HEC regulates the operation of private universities through defined policies and procedures to maintain and sustain academic excellence. However, key matters such as approving new programs, recruiting key management academic members, conducting workshops and conferences, require a thorough involvement of the HEC, which delays the process, hence affecting the management of operations at the university. In addition, three national reviews fatigue the academic members and misplace their concentration on direct academic matters.Through interviews with key figures in the Higher Education Sector including leadership roles at HEIs and HEC, a group of risks were identified, who highlighted major risks such as actions affecting reputation risks, inefficient business model risks, mass education risks, long approval processes, repeated recognition, and accreditation requirements. In the light of a risk-based approach, this paper will highlight the risks that could suffer academic excellence at the universities. Recommendations will be placed at the HEI and HEC level to maintain sustainable academic excellence in higher education.","","978-1-6654-0714-4","10.1109/SLAE54202.2021.9788096","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9788096","regulations;risk-based approach;HEIs;management;reputation;mass education;mismatch","Training;Leadership;Engineering profession;Education;Licenses;Media;Accreditation","educational institutions;further education;human resource management;risk management;strategic planning;teaching","HEC;HEI management;financial risk;sustainable academic excellence;strategic risk;mass education risk;higher education council;higher education institutions leadership;higher education institutions management;HEI leadership;higher education sector;student-to-faculty ratio;Bahrain;public universities","","","","37","IEEE","6 Jun 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This paper proposes a novel efficient Improved ResU-Net architecture called IRU-Net, integrating spatial pyramid pooling module with an encoder-decoder structure, in combination with Atrous convolutions, modified residual connections, and a new skip connection between the encoder-decoder features for automatic extraction of buildings from RS images. Moreover, a new dual loss function called binary cross-entropy-dice-loss (BCEDL) is opted that make cross-entropy (CE) and dice loss (DL) and consider both local information and global information to decrease the class imbalance influence and improve the building extraction results. The proposed model is examined to demonstrate its generalization on two publicly available datasets; the Aerial Images for Roof Segmentation (AIRS) Dataset and the Massachusetts buildings dataset. The proposed IRU-Net achieved an average F-1 accuracy of 92.34% for the Massachusetts dataset and 95.65% for the AIRS dataset. When compared to other state-of-the-art deep learning-based models such as SegNet, U-Net, E-Net, ERFNet and SRI-Net, the overall accuracy improvements of our IRU-Net model is 9.0% (0.9725 vs. 0.8842), 5.2% (0.9725 vs. 0.9218), 3.0% (0.9725 vs. 0.9428), 1.4% (0.9725 vs. 0.9588) and 0.93% (0.9725 vs. 0.9635), for AIRS dataset and 11.6%, 5.9%, 3.1%, 2.7% and 1.4%, for Massachusetts building dataset.

Evidence of such behavior has been documented across almost all domains of DSE, including ridesharing, lodging, and freelancing. However, little is known about the underlying design decisions of DSE platforms which allow certain demographics of the market to gain unfair advantage over others. To bridge this knowledge gap, in this paper, we systematically synthesize evidence from 58 interdisciplinary studies to identify the pervasive discrimination concerns affecting DSE platforms along with their triggering features and mitigation strategies. Our objective is to consolidate such interdisciplinary evidence from a software design point of view. Our results show that existing evidence is mainly geared towards documenting and mitigating issues of racism and sexism affecting platforms of ridesharing, lodging, and freelancing.

As a result of this, in literature, different methods and techniques to make decision under an uncertain environment have been proposed. In this sense, the representation of imprecise data through fuzzy numbers has become a common practice in researches. In this chapter we study the problem of project portfolio selection when the resources are subject to budget availability. For this, we modeled the uncertainty in the total budget to carry out projects and the uncertainty in restricted budget to different areas using triangular fuzzy numbers. First, we describe a proposed bi‐objective fuzzy model inspired in the project selection model considering the decision of selection and resource allocation at task level. Then, we applied several methods to compare fuzzy numbers in order to transform the fuzzy programming model into a mathematical model with crisp values. Naturally, different methods resulted in different project portfolios. For this reason, the results of the application of the different methods to compare fuzzy numbers are discussed using one multi‐objective solution method for this research.","","9781119798774","10.1002/9781119798798.ch14","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9827681.pdf&bkn=9827658&pdfType=chapter","","Portfolios;Uncertainty;Programming;Task analysis;Proposals;Organizations;Stochastic processes","","","","","","","","13 Jul 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Telecom eBook Chapters"

Many uncertain conditions such as climate changes, fluctuations in market, flooding, etc., cause problems to the agricultural process. In this work, the prices of selected essential crops analyzed for time-series prediction using meta-learning. The Self-Organized Map (S OM), LSTM (Long-Short Term Model), and this proposed Meta-Learning Based Adaptive Crop Price Prediction (MLACPP) was trained using crop price dataset, and crop yield dataset. Meta-learning function used in the approach utilizes the input, optimization-output, and task-related estimators for calculating meta-loss over multiple meta-network. The meta-learning with self-organizing capability learns a meta-network observing additional information from specialized support set. Moreover, this method deals with a task-oriented loss. Interestingly, it compares the current optimal-output of the optimization function g with the target-specific information. Experimental results show significant improvement in terms of prediction accuracy and cross-correlation entropy over the existing crop price prediction approaches.

Although many SOD methods for RSIs have been proposed, there are still some problems, such as insufficient feature extraction, relatively worse detection results for tiny objects, and serious interference by background clutter and lighting shadows. In this article, we propose a novel multiscale feature enhancement network (MFENet) for SOD in optical RSIs. Specifically, MFENet first uses the global feature perception (GFP) module to extract the multiscale and global feature information of salient object regions. Second, the global features are enhanced from the channel and spatial dimensions by using the mixed feature enhancement (MFE) module. Third, the semantic feature guidance (SFG) module is constructed to guide the model to obtain fine-grained semantic feature information. Finally, the boundary optimization module (BOM) is designed to refine the boundary features and obtain accurate saliency detection results. To evaluate the performance of MFENet, extensive experiments are conducted on the publicly available ORSSD, EORSSD, and ORSI-4199 datasets. The quantitative and qualitative results show that our method outperforms the existing state-of-the-art SOD methods in several evaluation metrics and exhibits better inference speed (FPS) and calculation parameters.

In this article, we propose an efficient and general algorithm, which is called local affine preservation (LAP) matching, for robust feature matching of remote sensing images. We start by constructing the putative point correspondences according to the similarity of well-designed feature descriptors and then focus on removing false matches from the putative set. The key idea of LAP is to search motion-consistent neighborhoods and maintain the local neighborhood topological structures of the true putative matches. To this end, we present a local geometric constraint, which exploits the property of affine invariance to measure the preservation degree of neighborhood topology, since the property is still held under both rigid and complex nonrigid transformations for a minimum topological unit. Moreover, in order to avoid the random distribution of outliers to destroy the neighborhood structure preservation of inliers, a neighbor mining strategy is introduced to search motion-consistent neighbors for each correspondence. We formulate the problem into an optimization model and derive a closed-form solution with linearithmic time complexity. Extensive experimental results on remote sensing images demonstrate that our LAP is able to achieve better performance over the current state-of-the-art approaches.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2021.3128292","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61773295); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9615050","Affine invariance;feature matching;locality preservation;mismatch removal;motion consistency","Remote sensing;Feature extraction;Reliability;Topology;Task analysis;Parametric statistics;Image matching","computational complexity;computational geometry;data mining;feature extraction;geophysical image processing;image matching;image registration;photogrammetry;remote sensing;transforms","remote sensing images;putative point;well-designed feature descriptors;false matches;putative set;LAP;motion-consistent neighborhoods;local neighborhood topological structures;putative matches;local geometric constraint;affine invariance;preservation degree;neighborhood topology;motion-consistent neighbors;motion consistency;fundamental task;photogrammetry;feature matching endeavors;reliable correspondences;feature points;image pair;local affine preservation matching;robust feature matching","","4","","46","IEEE","15 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Running stream applications across these geo-distributed sites are emerging as a daily requirement, such as making business decisions from marketing streams, identifying spam campaigns from social network streams, and analyzing existing genomes in different labs and countries to track the sources of a potential epidemic. However, while the progress has been encouraging, the existing efforts have dominantly centered around stateless stream processing, leaving another urgent trend-stateful stream processing-much less explored. A driving need is that next-generation stream processing systems need to store and update states during processing, and most importantly, successfully recover large distributed states when faults and failures happen. Existing studies exhibit major limitations including: (1) they mostly inherit MapReduce's “single master/many workers” architecture, where the central master is responsible for all scheduling activities and easily becomes a scalability bottleneck; (2) they offer state recovery mainly through the use of three approaches: replication recovery, checkpointing recovery, and DStream-based lineage recovery, which are either slow, resource-expensive or failing to handle multiple failures; and (3) they are not adaptive to heterogeneous hardware settings in the cloud. In this paper, we present A-FP4S, a novel adaptive fragments-based parallel state recovery mechanism for stream processing systems to manage and recover large distributed states for a massive number of stream applications. The novelty of A-FP4S is that we organize stream operators into a distributed hash table (DHT) based peer-to-peer (P2P) overlay. Then we divide each node's local state into many fragments and periodically store them in each node's multiple neighbors (the leaf set nodes of DHT), ensuring that different sets of available fragments can reconstruct failed states in parallel. By doing that, this failure recovery mechanism is extremely scalable to the size of the lost state, significantly reduces the failure recovery time, and can tolerate multiple node failures. A-FP4S is adaptive to heterogeneous hardware settings (e.g., CPU speed, disk/file-system speed, network bandwidth) by automatic parameter tuning over phases. Compared to Apache Storm, A-FP4S achieves a significant 31.8% to 50.5% reduction in recovery latency. It can scale to many simultaneous failures and successfully recover the state, even more than half of the operators fail or get lost. Large-scale experiments using real-world datasets demonstrate A-FP4S's attractive scalability and adaptivity properties.","1558-2183","","10.1109/TPDS.2023.3251997","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10077765","State Recovery;Distributed Hash Tables;Stream Processing","Checkpointing;Task analysis;Storms;Peer-to-peer computing;Hardware;Codes;Adaptive systems","","","","","","","IEEE","21 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

To close this gap, we propose a Multi-GPU Training Framework (MTFC) for Cube-CNN-based HSI classification. We first design a Parallel Neighbor Pixel Extraction (PNPE) algorithm for efficiently generating 3-dimensional cube samples from raw data. Then, to fully exploit massive GPU parallelism and realize unique characteristics of HSI and Cube-CNN, we employ optimizations in MTFC such as task division, fine-grained mapping between tasks and GPU thread blocks, shared memory usage reduction, etc. Finally, to further improve training speed, we take advantage of CUDA streams and multiple GPUs to train a mini-batches of data samples simultaneously. An extensive set of experiments highlights that MTFC constantly outperforms the two baselines Caffe and Theano for all measured metrics across all system configurations, while offering the same level of classification accuracy.

While attempts are being made to make primary diagnosis more reliable and accessible in places with high tuberculosis rates, Chest X-rays has become a popular source. However, specialist radiologists are required for the screening process, which could be a challenge in developing countries. For early diagnosis of tuberculosis utilizing CXR images, a complete automatic system of tuberculosis detection can decrease the need for trained staff. Various deep learning and machine learning technologies have been introduced in recent years for examining digital chest radiographs for TB-related variances with the goal of reducing inter-class reader variability and reproducibility, as well as providing radiologic services in areas where radiologists are not available. Tuberculosis is sometimes misclassified as other conditions with similar radiographic patterns as a result of CXR images, resulting in inefficient therapy. The current approach, however, is limited to Computer-Aided Detection (CAD), which has only been evaluated with non-deep learning models. Deep neural networks open potentially new avenues for tuberculosis treatment. There are no peer-reviewed studies comparing the effectiveness of various deep learning systems in detecting TB anomalies, and none compare multiple deep learning systems with human readers. In this paper, the aim of the proposed method is to develop an efficient tuberculosis detection system based on stochastic learning with artificial neural network (ANN) model by random variations using Chest X-ray images. This approach can able to incorporate random functions into the network, either by assigning stochastic transfer functions to the network or by assigning stochastic weights to the network. This proposed method is to learn features from CXR images and optimize the parameters of an ANN model by randomly mixing the training dataset before each iteration, resulting in varied ordering of model parameter updates. Furthermore, in a neural network, model weights are frequently initialized at a random beginning point. By focusing on randomness functions with optimization, the proposed technique achieved great accuracy. The motivation of the proposed method is to detect abnormalities in CXR with the different levels of complexity of TB by strong or weak evidence with different deep geometric contexts such as shape, size, cavitation, and density. ANN’s primary benefit is extracting hidden linear and non-linear inter-relationships of high-dimensional and complex data. The proposed method was systematically tested with the Shenzhen and Montgomery datasets using metrics such as sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy, and it was discovered that the proposed method attained better accuracy when compared to state-of-the-art methods. The proposed method shows an improved efficiency with sensitivity of 96.12%, specificity of 98.01%, accuracy 98.45% and F-Score 95.88% respectively.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3208882","Princess Nourah bint Abdulrahman University Researchers Supporting Project(grant numbers:PNURSP2022R79); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9900305","Artificial neural network (ANN);chest X-ray;computer-ided detection (CAD);deep learning;stochastic learning;tuberculosis (TB)","Tuberculosis;Solid modeling;Deep learning;Stochastic processes;X-ray imaging;Lung;Biomedical imaging;Artificial neural networks","backpropagation;deep learning (artificial intelligence);diagnostic radiography;diseases;feature extraction;image classification;learning (artificial intelligence);lung;medical image processing;radiology","radiographic patterns;CXR images;computer-aided detection;nondeep learning models;deep neural networks;tuberculosis treatment;deep learning systems;random variations;chest X-ray images;random functions;stochastic transfer functions;stochastic weights;ANN model;random beginning point;randomness functions;high-dimensional data;stochastic learning-based artificial neural network model;automatic tuberculosis Detection system;primary diagnosis;Chest X-rays;automatic system;trained staff;machine learning technologies;digital chest radiographs;TB-related variances;tuberculosis rates;high-fatality rate;tuberculosis detection system","","","","38","CCBY","22 Sep 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

It enforces that positive pairs become close while negative pairs become far. Contrastive learning utilizes the relative proximity or distance between positive and negative pairs. However, contrastive learning might fail to handle the easily distinguished positive-negative pairs because the gradient of easily divided positive-negative pairs comes to vanish. To overcome the problem, we propose a dynamic mixed margin (DMM) loss that generates the augmented hard positive-negative pairs that are not easily clarified. DMM generates hard positive-negative pairs by interpolating the dataset with Mixup. Besides, DMM adopts the dynamic margin incorporating the interpolation ratio, and dynamic adaptation improves representation learning. DMM encourages making close for positive pairs far away, whereas making a little far for strongly nearby positive pairs alleviates overfitting. Our proposed DMM is a plug-and-play module compatible with diverse contrastive learning loss and metric learning. We validate that the DMM is superior to other baselines on various tasks, video-text retrieval, and recommender system task in unimodal and multimodal settings. Besides, representation learned from DMM shows better robustness even if the modality missing occurs that frequently appears on the real-world dataset.

However, this type of data has unsatisfactory characteristics, e.g., many colloquial vocabularies and sparse content. To solve these problems, we propose the KTI-RNN model for unstructured data recognition. The proposed model overcomes sparse content and obtains good classification results.

As an important method in data mining, decision tree data mining has been applied to all walks of life. Decision tree is an example-based inductive algorithm, which focuses on reasoning out the classification rules of decision tree representation from a group of unordered and irregular cases. In this paper, the change of forest resources is detected based on the decision tree algorithm. By comparing the change detection results of different feature vectors, conventional change vector analysis and difference method, better detection methods and results of forest resources change are obtained.

In this paper, to better align image and language domains in diverse and unrestricted cases, we propose a novel neural network model that performs global reasoning on a dependency tree parsed from the question; thus, our model is called a parse-tree-guided reasoning network (PTGRN). This network consists of three collaborative modules: i) an attention module that exploits the local visual evidence of each word parsed from the question, ii) a gated residual composition module that composes the previously mined evidence, and iii) a parse-tree-guided propagation module that passes the mined evidence along the parse tree. Thus, PTGRN is capable of building an interpretable visual question answering (VQA) system that gradually derives image cues following question-driven parse-tree reasoning. Experiments on relational datasets demonstrate the superiority of PTGRN over current state-of-the-art VQA methods, and the visualization results highlight the explainable capability of our reasoning system.","1939-3539","","10.1109/TPAMI.2019.2943456","State Key Development Program(grant numbers:2018YFC0830103); National High Level Talents Special Support Plan; National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:U1811463,61836012); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8847465","Visual question answering;image and language parsing;deep reasoning;attention model","Cognition;Visualization;Layout;Logic gates;Task analysis;Knowledge discovery;Image coding","grammars;inference mechanisms;learning (artificial intelligence);natural language processing;neural nets;question answering (information retrieval);trees (mathematics)","collaborative reasoning;image-question pairs;visual question answering system;explicit compositional processes;valid reasoning processes;compositional reasoning;neural network model;dependency tree;parse-tree-guided reasoning network;PTGRN;collaborative modules;attention module;local visual evidence;residual composition module;parse-tree-guided propagation module;question-driven parse-tree reasoning","","19","","49","IEEE","24 Sep 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, most current CD methods use single- or dual-stream networks to extract change features, which is insufficient to extract and learn bitemporal change information thoroughly. This article proposes a triple-stream network (TSNet) with cross-stage feature fusion for CD in high-resolution bitemporal remote sensing images. First, to obtain highly representative deep features in the original image, we perform feature extraction on bitemporal remote sensing images and their concatenated image with a dual-stream encoder and a single-stream encoder, respectively. Then, the bitemporal multiscale features extracted by the dual-stream encoder are input into a multistage bidirectional convolutional gated recurrent unit (MSBC_GRU) feature fusion module, allowing the network to learn the change information in a cross-stage manner. In addition, we use a dual-channel attention module to fuse the features extracted by dual- and single-stream encoders, improving the network’s ability to discriminate changed features.

It is essential for prognosis and early diagnosis for various cardiac diseases. However, the complex motion procedure of the myocardium and the invisible pattern differences pose great challenges, leading to low performance for automatic methods. Most existing works mitigate the task by differentiating the normal motion patterns from the abnormal ones, without fine-grained motion scoring. We propose an effective method for the task of cardiac motion scoring by connecting a bottom-up and another top-down branch with a novel motion-based spatial attention module in multi-scale space. Specifically, we use the convolution blocks for low-level feature extraction that acts as a bottom-up mechanism, and the task of optical flow for explicit motion extraction that acts as a top-down mechanism for high-level allocation of spatial attention.

Among various de-identification (anonymization) techniques,  $k$ -anonymous microaggregation has been widely studied since it enables us to balance between confidentiality and data utility. Despite plenty of microaggregation methods in the sense of reducing the information loss and/or computational complexity, machine learning (ML) models using the resulting aggregated data face the problem that they are not as effective as expected. Motivated by the fact that ML models can be heavily influenced by distorted training data (albeit slightly), we deliberate on the performance of microaggregation in terms of not only data privacy but also data utility. In this paper, we propose Util-MA, a new utility-embraced microaggregation framework for effective ML applications. Specifically, unlike prior studies that apply microaggregation techniques directly to raw data, we design a unified framework that can potentially enhance the data utility while preserving the  $k$ -anonymity through preprocessing steps including dimensionality reduction and clustering. By using real-world datasets, we empirically demonstrate the superiority of Util-MA over benchmark microaggregation methods in terms of classification accuracy. Moreover, we investigate the importance of preprocessing by measuring key performance indicators (KPIs) of clustering; the clustering stage of Util-MA leads to high performance on the classification when the clustering results substantially coincide with the ground truth labels. We also establish a close relationship between the KPIs of clustering and the classification accuracies, which tends to be revealed when there is a gain of Util-MA over the benchmark method is observed. Our framework is microaggregation-model-agnostic; thus, underlying microaggregation models can be appropriately chosen according to one’s needs and ML tasks.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3183201","National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) Grant by the Korean Government through MSIT(grant numbers:2021R1A2C3004345); Institute of Information and Communications Technology Planning and Evaluation (IITP) Grant by the Korean Government through MSIT (6G Post-MAC—POsitioning and Spectrum-Aware intelligenT MAC for Computing and Communication Convergence)(grant numbers:2021-0-00347); Yonsei University Research Fund of 2021(grant numbers:2021-22-0083); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9796546","Clustering;data utility;dimensionality reduction;k-anonymity;microaggregation","Data models;Data privacy;Computational modeling;Benchmark testing;Task analysis;Dimensionality reduction;Business","computational complexity;data privacy;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;pattern clustering;security of data","data utility;Util-MA;benchmark microaggregation methods;microaggregation-model-agnostic;underlying microaggregation models;machine learning applications;de-identification techniques;k-anonymous microaggregation;machine learning models;resulting aggregated data;ML models;distorted training data;data privacy;utility-embraced microaggregation framework;effective ML applications;microaggregation techniques;raw data","","","","59","CCBY","15 Jun 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, when tackling the problem of multidimensional chaotic time series prediction, due to the randomly generated rules for input and reservoir weights, not only the representation of valuable variables is enriched but also redundant and irrelevant information is accumulated inevitably. To remove the redundant components, reduce the approximate collinearity among echo-state information, and improve the generalization and stability, a new method called hierarchical ESN with sparse learning (HESN-SL) is proposed. The HESN-SL mines and captures the latent evolution patterns hidden from the dynamic system by means of layer-by-layer processing in stacked reservoirs, and leverage monotone accelerated proximal gradient algorithm to train a sparse output layer with variable selection capability. Meanwhile, we further prove that the HESN-SL satisfies the echo state property, which guarantees the stability and convergence of the proposed model when applied to time series prediction.

Nevertheless, with the increasing adoption and presence of IoT services, it becomes more difficult to find the appropriate IoT service compositions that can maximize the service utility of all the users' requests. Moreover, the IoT devices are usually resource constrained and cannot effectively finish some complex task of service requests, thereby reducing the service quality. To address this problem, we develop a novel IoT service allocation mechanism in collaborative device-edge-cloud architecture. First, prevalence of frequent function interaction is mined to help construct IoT service allocation index. Second, service requests' priority and their preferences towards branch nodes are further set and estimated to help maximize the service composition utility of multiple user requests. Third, edge device is exploited to help service execution and guarantee service allocation utility by offloading task from IoT devices.

To alleviate these issues, we first introduce a deep hierarchical layer aggregation (DHLA) strategy, which utilizes a block-based layer aggregation to aggregate representations from different layers and transfers the output of the previous block to the subsequent block, so that deeper MPNNs can be easily trained. Additionally, to stabilize the training process, we also develop a novel normalization strategy, neighbor normalization (NeighborNorm), which normalizes the neighbor of each node to further address the training issue in deep MPNNs. Our analysis reveals that NeighborNorm can smooth the gradient of the loss function, i.e., adding NeighborNorm makes the optimization landscape much easier to navigate.

Although recent research has made impressive advances, it remains a challenge to sufficiently capture the correlations across modalities due to the high-dimensional nonlinear characteristics of individual modalities and the conflicts in heterogeneous modalities. In addition, the meaningless modality-private information in each modality might become dominant in the process of correlation mining, which also interferes with the clustering performance. To tackle these challenges, we devise a novel deep correlated information bottleneck (DCIB) method, which aims at exploring the correlation information between multiple modalities while eliminating the modality-private information in each modality in an end-to-end manner. Specifically, DCIB treats the CMC task as a two-stage data compression procedure, in which the modality-private information in each modality is eliminated under the guidance of the shared representation of multiple modalities. Meanwhile, the correlations between multiple modalities are preserved from the aspects of feature distributions and clustering assignments simultaneously. Finally, the objective of DCIB is formulated as an objective function based on a mutual information measurement, in which a variational optimization approach is proposed to ensure its convergence.

Recently, researchers have introduced ReQA into the biomedical domain as BioReQA. Typically BioReQA models rely on the dual-encoder to gain semantic representation and are trained following the settings of dense retrieval. However, they normally utilize easy in-batch negative samples in training process to avoid the extra forwarding cost and GPU memory required by encoding additional negative samples. However, hard negative samples have been proved more important with regard to the overall performance of BioReQA tasks. Therefore in this research, we focus on effectively constructing hard in-batch negative samples. Inspired by the classic linear assignment problem, we propose an Iterative Linear Assignment Grouping (ILAG) algorithm to construct hard in-batch negative samples. To further enhance performance for given hard batches in a low-resource scenario, we also employ adversarial training to augment the difficulty of batches.

The rough hypercuboid approach is an emerging technique that can be applied to eliminate irrelevant and redundant features, especially for the inexactness problem in approximate numerical classification. By integrating the meta-heuristic-based evolutionary search technique, a novel global search method for numerical feature selection is proposed in this article based on the hybridization of the rough hypercuboid approach and binary particle swarm optimization (BPSO) algorithm, namely RH-BPSO. To further alleviate the issue of high computational cost when processing large-scale datasets, parallelization approaches for calculating the hybrid feature evaluation criteria are presented by decomposing and recombining hypercuboid equivalence partition matrix via horizontal data partitioning. A distributed meta-heuristic optimized rough hypercuboid feature selection (DiRH-BPSO) algorithm is thus developed and embedded in the Apache Spark cloud computing model. Extensive experimental results indicate that RH-BPSO is promising and can significantly outperform the other representative feature selection algorithms in terms of classification accuracy, the cardinality of the selected feature subset, and execution efficiency. Moreover, experiments on distributed-memory multicore clusters show that DiRH-BPSO is significantly faster than its sequential counterpart and is perfectly capable of completing large-scale feature selection tasks that fail on a single node due to memory constraints. Parallel scalability and extensibility analysis also demonstrate that DiRH-BPSO could scale out and extend well with the growth of computational nodes and the volume of data.","2162-2388","","10.1109/TNNLS.2022.3171614","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62076171,61573292,61976182); Youth Fund Project of Humanities and Social Science Research of Ministry of Education(grant numbers:21YJCZH045); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9773310","Feature selection;hypercuboid;parallel computing;particle swarm optimization;rough sets.","Feature extraction;Rough sets;Sparks;Computational modeling;Partitioning algorithms;Particle swarm optimization;Heuristic algorithms","","","","4","","","IEEE","12 May 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

At the same time, new high-level synthesis compilers like Xilinx Vitis and runtime libraries such as XRT attract software programmers into the reconfigurable domain. While software programmers are familiar with task-level and data-parallel programming, FPGAs often require different types of parallelism. For example, data-driven parallelism is mandatory to obtain satisfactory hardware designs for pipelined dataflow architectures. However, software programmers are often not acquainted with dataflow architectures— resulting in poor hardware designs. In this work we present FLOWER, a comprehensive compiler infrastructure that provides automatic canonical transformations for high-level synthesis from a domain-specific library. This allows programmers to focus on algorithm implementations rather than low-level optimizations for dataflow architectures. We show that FLOWER allows to synthesize efficient implementations for high-performance streaming applications targeting System-on-Chip and FPGA accelerator cards, in the context of image processing and computer vision.","","978-1-6654-2010-5","10.1109/ICFPT52863.2021.9609930","BMBF; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9609930","high-level synthesis;dataflow;compiler;FPGA;transformations;high-performance computing","Program processors;Codes;Computer architecture;Streaming media;Parallel processing;Software;Libraries","circuit analysis computing;data flow computing;field programmable gate arrays;high level synthesis;parallel programming;program compilers;software architecture","FLOWER;comprehensive dataflow compiler;FPGA accelerator cards;data centers;accelerator cards;reconfigurable computing;high-performance applications;high-level synthesis compilers;runtime libraries;software programmers;task-level programming;data-parallel programming;data-driven parallelism;pipelined dataflow architectures;hardware designs;comprehensive compiler infrastructure;domain-specific library;low-level optimizations;high-performance streaming applications;automatic canonical transformations;system-on-chip;image processing;computer vision;Xilinx Vitis;XRT","","2","","36","IEEE","23 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Namely, they perform poorly for multidimensional sparse data. A straightforward solution is to create forests of decision trees with oblique splits; however, most training approaches have low performance. Besides, those ensembles appear unstable and easily overfit, so they should be regularized to find the trade-off between complexity and generalization. This paper proposes an algorithm to train kernel decision trees and random forests. At the top level, this algorithm follows a common greedy procedure to train decision trees; however, it produces quasi-optimal oblique and kernel splits at the decision stump level. At each stump, the algorithm finds a quasi-optimal distribution of classes to subtrees and trains this stump via optimization of an SVM-like loss function with a margin re-scaling approach, which helps optimize the margin between subtree data and arbitrary impurity criteria. We also try to reveal uniform stability-based generalization bounds for those forests and apply them to select the regularization technique. The obtained bounds explicitly consider primary hyperparameters of forests, trees, and decision stumps. The bounds also show a relationship between outliers in decision tree structure, stability and generalization, and illustrate how forests smooth these outliers. We performed an experimental evaluation on several tasks, such as studying the reaction of social media users, image recognition, and bank scoring. The experiments show that the proposed algorithm trains ensembles, which outperform other oblique or kernel forests in many commonly-recognized datasets. Namely, the proposed algorithm shows 99.1% accuracy on MNIST and 58.1% on CIFAR-10. It has been confirmed that the selected regularization technique helps reduce overfitting on several datasets. Therefore, the proposed algorithm may be considered a small step toward customized and regularized ensembles of kernel trees that keep reasonable training performance on large datasets. We believe that the proposed algorithm can be utilized as a construction element of approaches to training context-aware models on complex problems with integer inputs and outputs, such as text mining and image recognition.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3193385","Ministry of Science and Higher Education of the Russian Federation(grant numbers:075-15-2020-799); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9837906","Generalization bounds;kernel splits;kernel forests;random forests;random uniform stability;regularization;slack re-scaling","Kernel;Random forests;Training;Decision trees;Forestry;Stability criteria;Task analysis","data mining;decision trees;greedy algorithms;image recognition;learning (artificial intelligence);optimisation;pattern classification;support vector machines;trees (mathematics)","subtree data;uniform stability-based generalization bounds;decision stumps;algorithm trains ensembles;selected regularization technique;customized regularized ensembles;kernel trees;reasonable training performance;training context-aware models;random kernel forests;random forests;axis-parallel decision trees;competitive accuracy;multidimensional sparse data;oblique splits;training approaches;trade-off between complexity;kernel decision trees;common greedy procedure;decision stump level;subtrees","","1","","46","CCBY","25 Jul 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Recently, the adoption of deep learning techniques has gained significant performance improvement. However, most existing studies focused on exploiting the spatial information of gait data (using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)) while the temporal part received little attention. In this study, we propose a new multi-model Long Short-term Memory (LSTM) network for learning the gait temporal features. First, we observe that LSTM is able to capture the pattern hidden inside the gait data sequences that are out-of-synchronization. Thus, instead of using the gait cycle-based segment, our model accepts the gait cycle-free segment (i.e., fixed-length window) as the input. By this, the classification task does not depend on the gait cycle detection task, which usually suffers from noise and bias. Second, we propose a new LSTM network architecture, in which, one LSTM is used for each gait data channel and a group of consecutive signals is processed in each step. This strategy allows the network to effectively handle the long input data sequence and achieve improved performance compared to existing LSTM-based gait models. In addition, besides using the LSTM alone, we extend it by combining with a CNN model to construct a hybrid network, which further improves the recognition performance. We evaluated our LSTM and hybrid networks under different settings using the whuGAIT and OU-ISIR datasets. The experiments showed that our LSTM network outperformed the existing LSTM networks, and its combination with CNN established new state-of-the-art performance on both the verification and identification tasks.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3056880","Institute of Information & Communications Technology Planning & Evaluation (IITP) grant by the Korean Government, Ministry of Science and ICT (MSIT) (Research on AI-Based Cryptanalysis and Security Evaluation)(grant numbers:2020-0-00126); Vietnam National University (VNU-HCM)(grant numbers:NCM2019-18-01); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9345743","Gait authentication;gait recognition;wearable sensor data;recurrent neural network;LSTM network","Gait recognition;Task analysis;Feature extraction;Gyroscopes;Legged locomotion;Data mining;Computer vision","convolutional neural nets;deep learning (artificial intelligence);feature extraction;gait analysis;image motion analysis;image segmentation;object recognition;recurrent neural nets","gait recognition;window-based data segment;user recognition;deep learning techniques;convolutional neural network;gait temporal features;gait data sequences;gait cycle-based segment;gait cycle-free segment;gait cycle detection task;LSTM network architecture;gait data channel;long input data sequence;CNN model;LSTM networks;LSTM-based gait models;multimodel long short-term memory network;inertial measurement units-based gait analysis;whuGAIT dataset;OU-ISIR dataset","","18","","44","CCBYNCND","3 Feb 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Simultaneously, the proposed architecture completed the selection with the optimization of the band reconstruction by a defined loss function. In this way, we supply substitution for selection criterion and path searching through the end-to-end framework.

Existing adaptation methods for cross-scene classification only consider the marginal distribution, while the conditional distribution is equally important in real applications. In addition, approaches based on deep learning align the distribution of features extracted from a single-scale structure, leading to the loss of information. To overcome the above drawbacks, an Attention-based Multiscale Residual Adaptation Network (AMRAN) is proposed for cross-scene classification tasks. In the proposed AMRAN, both the marginal and conditional distributions are taken into consideration for more comprehensive alignment.

In response to the above issues, we propose a series of self-encoding networks based on BLS from the perspective of unsupervised feature extraction. These include the single hidden layer autoencoder built on the basis of BLS(BLS-AE), the stacked BLS-based autoencoder (ST-BLS), the sparse BLS-based autoencoder (SP-BLS), and the stacked sparse BLS-based autoencoder(SS-BLS). The proposed BLS-based self-encoding networks retain the advantage of efficient BLS model training, and overcome the time-consuming defect of iterative parameter optimization in traditional self-encoding networks. In addition, the higher-level abstract features of the input data can be learned through the progressive encoding and decoding process. Combining $L_1$L1 regularization to train the parameters can further enhance the robustness of the extracted features.

In addition, in the process of segmenting sentences into words, considering that jieba will cause the loss of key information and ngram will generate noise words, both jieba and ngram are used to construct a six-granularity (i.e. word-jieba, word-jieba-radical, word-ngram, word-ngram-radical, character and character-radical) based Chinese short text classification (SGCSTC) model. Additionally, different weights are assigned to the six granularities and are automatically updated in the process of back-propagation using cross-entropy loss due to the different influence of them on the classification results.

This is done to improve radiation therapy's capacity to target the tumour with more precision. However, both noise and streaking aberrations significantly reduce the quality of 4D CBCT pictures. This technique is known as ""very sparse-view CT,"" and it gets its name from the fact that it only requires a limited number of under-sampled projections to reconstruct each phase of a phase-resolved picture. The strategy's name derives from the fact that it employs a limited number of predictions to achieve its objectives. Customers can select between two specialized Convolution Neural Network (CNN) models: N-Net and the proposed model. These models were developed to boost our confidence in the quality of the 4D CBCT images we provide. To execute this assignment, it was critical to have access to a large dataset. This is now achievable because of research that resulted in an advancement in 4D CBCT that made it practicable. Each phase-resolved picture produced by the N-Net network, which is presently under development, is expected to outperform the image produced before it in the production chain. This earlier picture was rebuilt using U-Net using the complete projection data. This was done to demonstrate the effectiveness of the N-Net technique. This is done to ensure that the reconstructed picture has the maximum possible level of accuracy. The proposed model network is based on the N-Net foundation and takes into consideration the temporal correlations visible in phase-resolved pictures. After assessing the validity of the suggested CNNs using XCAT simulation data, further testing was performed utilizing real patient 4D CBCT datasets to corroborate the findings. We went through all of this difficulty in order to assist CNN. Each of these networks exceeds the most powerful CNN models currently available as well as the two most complex iterative strategies in terms of their ability to minimize streaking artefacts and noise while also obtaining distinguishing features. The proposed approach's ability to tackle difficult tasks requiring a diverse mix of patient datasets and imaging technologies demonstrates its broad applicability. This was one of the first things we learned about the problem.","","979-8-3503-3564-4","10.1109/ICBATS57792.2023.10111314","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10111314","Four-Dimensional Cone-Beam Computed Tomography;Convolution Neural Network;Deep Learning;Image Enhancement","Training;Monte Carlo methods;Three-dimensional displays;Computed tomography;Spatiotemporal phenomena;Convolutional neural networks;Task analysis","computerised tomography;convolutional neural nets;image enhancement;image reconstruction;iterative methods;medical image processing;phantoms;radiation therapy;tumours","4D CBCT images;4D CBCT pictures;four-dimensional cone-beam computed tomography;image enhancement;image-guided radiation treatment;N-Net technique;patient datasets;phase-resolved picture;phase-resolved reconstructions;radiation therapy;real patient 4D CBCT datasets;specialized convolution neural network models;streaking aberrations;undersampled projections;very sparse-view CT technique;XCAT simulation data","","","","69","IEEE","15 May 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In recent years, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have become an important choice in the field of semantic segmentation of remote sensing images. However, generic CNN models present many problems when performing water body segmentation, such as: 1) blurred water body boundaries; 2) difficulty in accommodating different scales of rivers, often losing information about many small-scale rivers; and 3) a large number of trainable parameters. This article proposes an end-to-end CNN structure based on multiscale residuals and squeeze-and-excitation (SE)-attention for water segmentation, called MRSE-Net. MRSE-Net consists of an encoder–decoder and a skip connection, which captures contextual information at different scales using the encoder, and then passes the encoder feature mapping through the improved skip connection, while localization is achieved by the decoder is implemented. With the multiscale residual module, the number of parameters in our model can be significantly reduced and water pixels can be extracted accurately. The SE-attention module is used to enhance the prediction results, mitigate the blurring effect, and make the segmented water boundaries more continuous. Landsat-8 images are used to train our model and validate our proposed method’s performance and effectiveness. In addition, we evaluate our method on Landsat-7 and Sentinel-2 images and obtain the best water segmentation results. Preliminary results on Sentinel-2 images show that the cross-sensor generalization capability of our model is beyond the range of the Landsat sensor family.","2151-1535","","10.1109/JSTARS.2022.3185245","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61772319,62002200,61972235,12001327); Shandong Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:ZR2021QF134,ZR2021MF068); Yantai science and technology innovation development plan(grant numbers:2022JCYJ031); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9803863","Convolutional neural network (CNN);deep learning;multiscale residual;SE-attention;satellite image analysis;water body extraction","Remote sensing;Image segmentation;Feature extraction;Semantics;Earth;Rivers;Convolutional neural networks","convolutional neural nets;feature extraction;geophysical image processing;hydrological techniques;image segmentation;remote sensing;rivers","blurring effect;Landsat-8 image;Sentinel-2 images;satellite images;automatic extraction;image interpretation;convolutional neural networks;semantic segmentation;remote sensing images;generic CNN models;water body segmentation;small-scale rivers;end-to-end CNN structure;squeeze-and-excitation-attention;multiscale residual module;water pixels;SE-attention module;MRSE-Net;squeeze-and-excitation-attention network;blurred water body boundaries;Landsat-7 image;cross-sensor generalization capability","","5","","77","CCBY","22 Jun 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The summaries generated by abstractive summarization models often contain various kinds of factual errors. Thus, fact correction becomes essential to apply abstractive summarization to real-world applications. However, most existing methods for fact correction focus only on entity-level errors, which occasions the error correction methods to miss non-entity errors such as inconsistent tokens or mentions. Therefore, this paper presents a token-level fact correction that resolves inconsistencies of a system-generated summary at the token level. Since a token is the smallest meaning-bearing unit, all kinds of errors can be corrected if the errors are rectified at this level. The proposed fact corrector examines the consistency of a summary at the summary level like existing methods, but corrects the found inconsistencies at the token level. Thus, the proposed corrector consists of three modules of a summary fact checker, a token fact checker, and a fact emender. The summary fact checker inspects if a system-generated summary is factually consistent with a source text, the token fact checker finds out the tokens which cause inconsistency, and the fact emender actually replaces the inconsistency-causing tokens with correct tokens in the source text. Since these modules are closely related and affect one another, they are jointly trained to improve the performance of each module. The effectiveness of the proposed fact corrector is empirically proven from two viewpoints of consistency and summarization performance. For correcting inconsistencies in a summary, it is shown that the summaries by the proposed corrector are more factually consistent than those by its competitors. In addition, the proposed corrector outperforms the current state-of-the-art corrector even in automatic summarization performance.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3233854","National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF); Korean Government (MSIT)(grant numbers:2021R1F1A1048181); Institute of Information and Communications Technology Planning and Evaluation (IITP); Korean Government (MSIT) through Artificial Intelligence Innovation Hub(grant numbers:2021-0-02068); Artificial Intelligence Convergence Innovation Human Resources Development (Kyung Hee University)(grant numbers:RS-2022-00155911); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10005108","Token-level fact correction;factual consistency in abstractive summarization;summary fact checker;token fact checker;fact emender","Training data;Error correction;Abstracts;Measurement;Content analysis;Data models;Data mining;Text analysis","abstracting;error correction;natural language processing;text analysis","abstractive summarization models;correct tokens;entity-level errors;error correction methods;fact corrector;fact emender;factual errors;inconsistency-causing tokens;inconsistent tokens;nonentity errors;smallest meaning-bearing unit;source text;source-consistent summary;summary fact checker;system-generated summary;token fact checker;token-level fact correction","","","","28","CCBY","3 Jan 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, severe spectral variabilities and inadequate spatial co-exploitation capabilities limit the performance of existing methods due to differences in acquisition times and conditions. Therefore, this article proposes a strategy of joint unmixing and multitemporal spatial information coguidance (JUC) to fully exploit the spatio-temporal-spectral features. First, a multitemporal joint unmixing method is used to achieve endmembers’ extraction and abundance estimation. Wherein the method adds spectral perturbed regularization when compared to the traditional unmixing strategy, making it robust to spectral variability. Second, we propose a multitemporal coguidance method that highlights the contrast between changed and unchanged regions and removes the noise by transferring the common structure information between the multitemporal first principal component map and the abundance difference maps. It will obtain an enhanced abundance difference maps and achieve effective combination of multitemporal spatial information. The final change result can be obtained by combining and thresholding these enhanced abundance difference maps.

It mainly consists of two procedures, i.e., endmember extraction and abundance estimation. Although most algorithms for each of the two procedures may exhibit good performance, few studies have been done considering both problems simultaneously. Therefore, hyperspectral unmixing accuracy is normally achieved by exploring all possible combinations of the two types of algorithms, which renders high computational overloads. We propose a novel orthogonal projection framework to conduct fast hyperspectral unmixing. It addresses both endmember extraction and abundance estimation with orthogonal projection endmember (OPE) and orthogonal projection abundance (OPA). Especially, the pixel with the largest orthogonal projection on any pixel is considered to be an endmember. We randomly choose one pixel from the hyperspectral data to compute the orthogonal projections of all pixels and extract the pixel with the largest projection as the first endmember. To avoid extracting the same endmembers, we compute orthogonal projections of all pixels to endmembers that have been previously extracted, and the pixel with the largest projection is considered as the next endmember. In terms of abundance estimation, we also utilize the concept of orthogonal projection and search for a diagonal matrix whose multiplication with the endmember matrix is not only a square matrix but also a diagonal matrix. Then, we exploit some specific matrix operations to estimate the abundance of each endmember at every pixel. We have evaluated the proposed OPE and OPA algorithms on synthetic and real data, and the experimental results have validated their effectiveness and efficiency in hyperspectral unmixing.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2022.3150263","Consejeria de Economia, Ciencia y Agencia Digital de la Junta de Extremadura and Fondo Europeo de Desarrollo Regional de la Union Eropea(grant numbers:GR21040); Spanish Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovacion(grant numbers:PID2019-110315RB-I00 (APRISA)); European Union’s Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Program(grant numbers:734541 (EOXPOSURE)); 2021 Leonardo Grant for Researchers and Cultural Creators, BBVA Foundation (the BBVA Foundation accepts no responsibility for the opinions, statements, and contents included in the project and/or the results thereof, which are entirely the responsibility of the authors); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9707781","Abundance estimation;endmember extraction;hyperspectral unmixing;orthogonal projection","Hyperspectral imaging;Estimation;Libraries;Data mining;Optimization;Task analysis;Solid modeling","geophysical image processing;hyperspectral imaging;matrix multiplication;remote sensing","abundance estimation;endmember matrix;fast orthogonal projection;hyperspectral image analysis;endmember extraction;fast hyperspectral unmixing;orthogonal projection abundance;hyperspectral data;OPA algorithm;OPE algorithm;orthogonal projection endmember;square matrix;diagonal matrix","","3","","40","IEEE","8 Feb 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Previous methods either convert point clouds as probability density models but ignore the rich feature of point clouds or only extract the local feature of point clouds without considering the global information. They did not fully utilize the point cloud information, so the characterization abilities of these methods are limited. To solve the above problems, we propose a point cloud registration based on learning Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) with global-weighted local representations. On the one hand, the point cloud is converted to GMM for registration. Unlike discrete point cloud data, GMM is a compact and lightweight representation. On the other hand, we generate GMM by extracting unique local features and global information from the point cloud. The global information is used to weigh the local features. Thus, the resulting GMM is a distribution with global-weighted local feature information representation ability, fully exploring the point cloud’s local and global information. At the same time, we design a learning guide module to directly solve the transformation without following the expectation maximization (EM)-solving paradigm. Benefiting from the combination of GMM and learning deep information, this formulation greatly improves the ability to characterize point clouds. Our method shows superiority in registration accuracy and generalization performance on synthetic and real-world datasets.

However, the richness of data comes at the expense of fundamental challenges such as abrupt shot changes and close up shots of actors with heavy truncation, which limits the applicability of existing 3D human understanding methods. In this paper, we address these limitations with the insight that while shot changes of the same scene incur a discontinuity between frames, the 3D structure of the scene still changes smoothly. This allows us to handle frames before and after the shot change as multi-view signal that provide strong cues to recover the 3D state of the actors. We propose a multi-shot optimization framework that realizes this insight, leading to improved 3D reconstruction and mining of sequences with pseudo-ground truth 3D human mesh. We treat this data as valuable supervision for models that enable human mesh recovery from movies; both from single image and from video, where we propose a transformer-based temporal encoder that can naturally handle missing observations due to shot changes in the input frames.

B-mode ultrasound (BUS), color Doppler flow imaging (CDFI), ultrasound elastography (UE) and dynamic contrast-enhanced ultrasound provide effective tools for identification but synthesis of modality information is a challenge for clinicians. Therefore, based on deep learning, rationally fusing these modalities with clinical information to personalize the classification of metastatic CLA requires new explorations. In this paper, we propose Multi-step Modality Fusion Network (MSMFN) for multi-modal ultrasound fusion to identify histological subtypes of metastatic CLA. MSMFN can mine the unique features of each modality and fuse them in a hierarchical three-step process. Specifically, first, under the guidance of high-level BUS semantic feature maps, information in CDFI and UE is extracted by modality interaction, and the static imaging feature vector is obtained. Then, a self-supervised feature orthogonalization loss is introduced to help learn modality heterogeneity features while maintaining maximal task-consistent category distinguishability of modalities. Finally, six encoded clinical information are utilized to avoid prediction bias and improve prediction ability further. Our three-fold cross-validation experiments demonstrate that our method surpasses clinicians and other multi-modal fusion methods with an accuracy of 80.06%, a true-positive rate of 81.81%, and a true-negative rate of 80.00%.

The number of cases has been increasing since the beginning of 2020. People are scared and trying to save themselves. Although many vaccines are designed to prevent disease, many governments across different countries have not been able to control the virus. Coronavirus has changed the way people live. It has a profound impact on parts of North America, South Asia and African countries. Even European countries have begun to adapt to the “new standard”. However, due to mismanagement and lack of essential facilities, the health care system in South Asian and African countries has collapsed. In India, there is scarcity of hospital equipment's such as Ventilators, beds, Oxygen bottles. According to WHO, India has only 5 hospital beds per 1000 persons and is ranked at 155th position among 167 countries. Although, the government has been trying their best to add hospitals beds and equipment's but they are not adequate enough to balance the rising cases of Coronavirus. Even after setting up only 3000 hospitals for the purpose of containing coronavirus and reducing its spread, many people in India died as a result of mistreatment by city officials and improper implementation of the rescue program. Apart from Coronavirus, there are many other diseases out there which are harmful and contagious, but such disease can be cured at home itself just by having a remote treatment from doctor. The patients do not need to visit a hospital, thus saving the beds and equipment's for the others who are in more need of it. To implement this idea, technology can be a blessing. In everyday life, people order food and cab within minutes and watch live stock market points and sports results on their mobile phones from time to time; where many businesses are successful only because they are able to meet the needs with greater management our technology can be used to provide people around the world with a simple Virtual Hospital web system that simplifies the Hospital Health Care process to help patients, doctors, labs, and chemists. This will not only help the people but also the hospital staff by reducing their paperwork and administrative responsibilities. Patients can easily book their appointments and can arrange an online examination with a doctor. The web application can be easily accessed from mobile phones, laptops and desktops and can be useful to people in such difficult times. In addition, the application can be partnered with authorized pharmacies to provide quality medicines at the discounted price.

Typically, GNNs reuses the same set of model parameters across all nodes in the graph to improve the training efficiency and exploit the translationally-invariant properties in many datasets. However, the parameter sharing scheme prevents GNNs from distinguishing two nodes that are isomorphic and that the translation invariance property may not exhibit in real-world graphs. In this paper, we present Graph Representation Learning with Adaptive Mixtures (GRAM), a novel approach for learning node representations in a graph by introducing multiple independent GNN models and a trainable mixture distribution for each node. GRAM is a general framework that can be readily embedded into existing models for enhancing representation learning. It allows for adaptive node clustering with mixtures and joint optimization of all GNN models simultaneously. To achieve this, we develop an Expectation-Maximization algorithm with stochastic gradient descent in a scalable manner. Specifically, in the E-Step, we approximate the posterior probability distribution of the latent cluster membership based on the k-th independent GNN models in the last iteration. In the M-step, we update all GNN models and the mixture parameters based on the refined latent cluster membership for downstream tasks, e.g., node classification. To fully exploit the graph structural information, we further implement a regularization term on unlabeled nodes, which encourages adjacent nodes to have the same mixture distribution. By jointly optimizing the model in an end-to-end manner, GRAM learns to capture different abstract patterns on graphs for different node clusters, which yields discriminative representation for each node. We evaluate GRAM on five benchmark datasets with extensive experiments. GRAM is demonstrated to consistently boost state-of-the-art GNN variants in node classification tasks.","2375-9259","978-1-6654-2427-1","10.1109/ICDMW53433.2021.00093","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9679943","graph neural networks;expectation-maximization algorithm;clustering;mixture models","Representation learning;Training;Adaptation models;Stochastic processes;Benchmark testing;Predictive models;Probability distribution","expectation-maximisation algorithm;gradient methods;graph theory;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;pattern clustering;probability","mixture parameters;refined latent cluster membership;graph structural information;unlabeled nodes;GRAM;different node clusters;discriminative representation;state-of-the-art GNN;node classification tasks;Graph Representation Learning;Adaptive Mixtures;Graph Neural Networks;GNNs;current state-of-the-art models;node representations;model parameters;translationally-invariant properties;parameter sharing scheme;translation invariance property;real-world graphs;multiple independent GNN models;trainable mixture distribution;adaptive node","","","","26","IEEE","20 Jan 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, this issue is becoming a challenge for computer vision because of various technical barriers, such as large-scale variation, complex background interference, and nonuniform density distribution. Recent results show hopeful prospects for object counting using convolutional neural networks (CNNs), but most existing CNN-based methods draw on larger and more complex architectures, which leads to a huge computational and storage burdens, severely limiting their application in real-world scenarios. In this article, a lightweight multiscale feature fusion network for remote sensing object counting, named LMSFFNet, is presented to achieve a better balance between the running speed of the network and the counting accuracy. Specifically, in the encoding process, we select a MobileViT module as the backbone of the network to reduce the numbers of network parameters and computing cost. In return, a cascade structure of the channel–spatial attention mechanisms compensates for the weaker feature extraction ability of the lightweight network.

By training models locally at each client and aggregating learning models at a central server, FL has the capability to avoid sharing data directly, thereby reducing privacy leakage. However, the conventional FL framework relies heavily on a single central server, and it may fail if such a server behaves maliciously. To address this single point of failure, in this work, a blockchain-assisted decentralized FL framework is investigated, which can prevent malicious clients from poisoning the learning process, and thus provides a self-motivated and reliable learning environment for clients. In this framework, the model aggregation process is fully decentralized and the tasks of training for FL and mining for blockchain are integrated into each participant. Privacy and resource-allocation issues are further investigated in the proposed framework, and a critical and unique issue inherent in the proposed framework is disclosed. In particular, a lazy client can simply duplicate models shared by other clients to reap benefits without contributing its resources to FL. To address these issues, analytical and experimental results are provided to shed light on possible solutions, i.e., adding noise to achieve local differential privacy and using pseudo-noise (PN) sequences as watermarks to detect lazy clients.","1556-6048","","10.1109/MCI.2022.3180932","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62002170,61872184); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(grant numbers:30919011274); Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province(grant numbers:BK20210331); Natural Science Fund of Guangdong Province(grant numbers:2020A1515010708); Natural Science Fund of Shenzhen(grant numbers:JCYJ20210324094609027); National Science Foundation(grant numbers:ECCS-2039716,CNS-2107216,CNS-2128368); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9833437","","Training data;Privacy;Computational modeling;Watermarking;Collaborative work;Data models;Blockchains","data mining;data privacy;learning (artificial intelligence)","local differential privacy;lazy client;resource-allocation issues;model aggregation process;reliable learning environment;self-motivated;learning process;malicious clients;blockchain-assisted;single central server;conventional FL framework;privacy leakage;aggregating learning models;training models;distributed machine learning paradigm;sensitive raw data;growing privacy concerns;end-user equipment;increasingly powerful computing capabilities;new distributed learning paradigm;federated learning meets blockchain","","14","","15","IEEE","19 Jul 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

Mainly, the exploitation of contextual information in a fixed receptive field is the focus of previous research, which makes it difficult to generically extract buildings that vary greatly in size and shape, especially when isolated large buildings are surrounded by dense small buildings. To improve this problem, we attempt to teach the network to adjust the receptive field and enhance useful feature information adaptively. In this article, we propose a novel adaptive screening feature network (ASF-Net), which can independently screen and enhance effective feature information from two aspects. On the one hand, we propose a deepened space up-sampling block to screen useful information and help establish boundaries. On the other hand, we propose an Adaptive Information Utilization Block (AIUB) to enlarge the receptive field of feature maps and refine the incomplete building footprint. As a result, the more accurate multiscale building footprint is inferred from the enhanced features. Experimental results on the popular aerial image segmentation datasets show that ASF-Net obtains competitive results [80.2% intersection over union (IoU) on the Inria aerial image labeling dataset and 74.2% IoU on the Massachusetts buildings dataset] in comparison with several state-of-the-art models.

Autonomous UAVs typically rely on Global Positioning System (GPS) usage and most operations require correct flight conditions with good visibility (no rain, fog nor smoke). However, some difficult environments are characterized by partial to no GPS signal, limiting the drone's ability to localise itself. Moreover, visual obscurants affect the UAV's performance and behaviour by restricting its visibility, adding complexity to some subsystems such as target detection. This paper presents the development of a framework enabling a drone to autonomously navigate and explore in GPS denied environments impacted by visual obscurants. The study illustrates this by formulating the navigation and target detection problem as an autonomous Sequential Decision Problem (SDP) with uncertainty caused by degraded visibility and lack of GPS. The SDP is modelled as a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) and tested using the Adaptive Belief Tree (ABT) algorithm. The navigation task was created following the model of a classic SAR operation in a cluttered indoor environment with visual obscurants. The framework includes target detection under uncertainty from a vision-based camera. The formulated SDP is tested in a simulated environment with partial observability and in presence of smoke. The framework integrates Gazebo, Robot Operating System (ROS), Software In The Loop (SITL) and PX4 firmware to recreate a SAR scenario in simulation. Experiments conducted in the simulated SAR scenario test the target finding task under different levels of visibility, with the target position being unknown, and a pose uncertainty modelled from real-life flight experiments. The experiments in normal visibility were a success, but the developed framework was limited in presence of visual obscurants, reducing the target detection rate. Allowing an UAV to autonomously navigate in challenging environments with low visibility conditions aims at increasing the range of UAV's utilization in critical applications such as SAR and mining, where human interventions are often dangerous and unfeasible.","1095-323X","978-1-6654-9032-0","10.1109/AERO55745.2023.10115544","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10115544","","Visualization;Adaptation models;Uncertainty;Navigation;Wildlife;Robot vision systems;Object detection","autonomous aerial vehicles;belief networks;decision theory;Markov processes;mobile robots;navigation;object detection;operating systems (computers);path planning;position control;robot programming;robot vision;trees (mathematics)","ABT algorithm;adaptive belief tree;autonomous sequential decision problem;autonomous UAV navigation;autonomous unmanned aerial vehicles;cluttered indoor environment;drone autonomous navigation;Gazebo;GPS denied environments;GPS signal;low visibility conditions;normal visibility;partial observability;partially observable Markov decision process;planetary exploration;pose uncertainty;PX4 firmware;robot operating system;SAR operation;SAR scenario test;SDP;SITL;software in the loop;target detection;target finding task;target position;UAV utilization;visibility degradation;vision-based camera;visual obscurants;visually degraded environment","","","","27","IEEE","15 May 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Where will we go?"" are essential for our present day civilisation. The first question is: on which path are we now, and where will it lead us. The other one is: which future do we want, and which path shall we take to get there.Where do we go? Well, we rush in all kinds of directions, like children we try out whatever can be done, but very, very rarely we consider system stability consequences. And that usually only much late after the destabilising action. Unfortunately, a general driving force of our civilisation can be detected: Faster, Better, More… A typical case of a dynamic system with a positive feedback loop. It is known that positive feedback, without a regulatory opposition of a negative feedback is destructive for a system at any level. Only a balanced regulatory process of positive and negative feedback is homeostatically sustainable. But, furthermore, the positive feedbacks (!) we constantly strive for are of extremely diverse natures, though all fall into the ""Faster, Better, More…"" category. This develops additional strain on the whole system stability [the whole (eco-)system of the geosphere, biosphere and technoshpere, as presently we pushed our survival possibilities largely into the sphere of technology]. However, the negative feedback comes from the whole ecosystem with, in human terms, very long latency, and than in ways which are either not obvious, or generally regarded irrelevant for everyday personal life, or generally regarded as terrible, but what can we do? So the question ""Where do we go?"" necessitates a thorough answer.But to know where we go it is essential to know the present state of the system. There are two highly pronounced areas of our civilisation's destabilisation of the system. The first is resource consumption, the second is garbage production. Both of those cling on uncontrollable overgrown consumerism, grown out of the contradictory philosophies and the conflicting economic and social principles throughout last several centuries. Constant uncertainties of future during that time, and an earth-shaking (even literally) change in technological surroundings, led to ""Let's enjoy the life while we can"" and ""Let's survive the day"" being some of the basic generic philosophical postulates prevailing in the subconscious of the population. Therefore, to answer the question, it is necessary to involve a huge amount of effort in two main directions: 1. Development of a model of the present eco-system state - where, what, how much, why… is researched, mined, produced, consumed, wasted… 2. Development of a philosophical framework which will enable global human acceptance of a stable nature-human-machine ecosystem.Where do we want to go? There are two main constraints for any sustainable future path: the unavoidable influence of ecosystem transformations on future production and distribution principles, and necessary adaptation of our wishes to the ecosystem stability needs. Firstly we will have to significantly reduce the wasteness of short-term products, unnecessary extreme energy consumption, enable long-term availability of spares and services, develop self-contained coordinated local economies, drastically reduce long-haul transport and ""re-educate"" ourselves in keeping in check our wishes for faster, better, more…The approaches of our future economy, which shall be based as much as possible locally, the production and product life-cycle management etc., will have to drastically change, from the level of prevailing philosophies and paradigmatic systems down to everyday life. With the use of properly organised local/global cybernetics and computer science aided coordination, through the emerging hierarchy from Dew to Cloud, it is possible to envisage a Rainbow Services System which would enable the existence of enough prerequisite variety and low latency information for timely decision making and action, as well as long term strategic planning, to achieve the sustainable longevity of our future civilisation.","2623-8764","978-953-233-103-5","10.23919/MIPRO55190.2022.9803356","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9803356","Smart Industry;Sustainability;Ecosystem Balance;Chaotic Developments","Industries;Economics;Energy consumption;Philosophical considerations;Negative feedback;Uncertainty;Ecosystems","ecology;economics;energy consumption;production engineering computing;strategic planning;sustainable development","system stability consequences;economic principles;social principles;production principle;distribution principle;ecosystem stability;economy;strategic planning;non-smart industry;sustainability;resource consumption;smart industry","","","","22","","27 Jun 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Therefore, a study was conducted to assess the acceptance of cloud computing among public sector users. This study aimed to test the factors influencing users' acceptance and how technology readiness factors determine their cloud computing acceptance by integrating the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology model and the Technology Readiness Index. The PLS-SEM analysis found that technology readiness factors greatly influence the acceptance of cloud computing. In addition, performance expectancy, compatibility, security, mobility, and social influence significantly impact the acceptance of cloud computing.

Embedded in these big data are valuable information and knowledge that can be discovered by data science, data mining and machine learning techniques. Electronic health (e-health) records are examples of the big data. With the technological advancements, more healthcare practice has gradually been supported by electronic processes and communication. This enables health informatics, in which computer science meets the healthcare sector to address healthcare and medical problems. As a concrete example, there have been more than 610 millions cumulative cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) worldwide over the past 2.5 years since COVID-19 has declared as a pandemic. As some of these cases require hospitalization. it is important to estimate the demand in hospitalization. Moreover, different levels of hospitalization may require different types of resources (e.g., hospital beds, medical staff). For example, patients admitted into the intensive care unit (ICU) may require assisted ventilation. Hence, in this paper, we present models to make predictions based on e-health records. Specifically, our binary model predicts whether a patient require hospitalization, whereas our multi-class model predicts what level of hospitalization (e.g., regular ward, semi-ICU, ICU) is required by the patient. Our models uses few-shot learning (and may use multi-task learning) with autoencoders (comprising encoders and decoders) and a predictor. Evaluation results on real-life e-health records show the practicality of our models in predicting hospital statuses of COVID-19 cases and the benefits of these models towards effective allocation of resources (e.g., hospital facilities, staff).","","978-1-6654-8016-1","10.1109/HealthCom54947.2022.9982738","University of Manitoba; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9982738","E-health;autoencoder;COVID-19;data analytics;data science;few-shot learning;health informatics;hospitalization;machine learning;prediction","COVID-19;Adaptation models;Hospitals;Predictive models;Big Data;Ventilation;Multitasking","data mining;diseases;electronic health records;health care;hospitals;learning (artificial intelligence)","autoencoders;Big Data;COVID-19 patients;data mining;electronic health records;electronic processes;few-shot learning;health informatics;healthcare sector;hospital beds;hospital status prediction;hospitalization;intensive care unit;machine learning techniques;medical problems;real-life e-health records","","","","29","IEEE","21 Dec 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

There are two key characteristics: 1) the multiscale spatial–spectral features are extracted by the multiscale pyramid convolution and enhanced by spatial–spectral residual attention module ( $\text {S}^{2} $ RAM) of each scale and 2) the multilevel features are obtained by aggregating the multiscale features level by level. As a result of this design, the proposed DMP $\text {s}^{2} $ raN learns more discriminative features with both strong semantic information and rich spatial–spectral information.

However, affected by the performance of the clustering method, within each cluster exists inevitably noisy instances, and self-paced contrastive learning usually requires a large number of negative samples from various classes, where false-negative samples give rise to the class collision issue. These lead to performing incorrect model optimization. In this paper, we propose a non-contrastive nearest neighbor identity-guided (NNNI) method to overcome these challenges. The advantage of NNNI is to provide the model with a highly accurate prior. Specifically, this method relies on the random identity sampler commonly used in re-identification tasks to provide the network with a regression target of the nearest neighbors of the same identity within a mini-batch. It encodes more and more information in an iterative process through a Siamese network with an exponential moving average to train high-quality representations. NNNI alleviates the negative effects of noise instances and corrects class collision issues during training. Extensive experiments show that our method is effective on unsupervised object re-identification and achieves state-of-the-art performance on three large-scale person re-identification datasets and one large-scale vehicle re-identification dataset, which is competitive with even supervised methods.","1558-2205","","10.1109/TCSVT.2022.3224994","Natural Science Foundation of Shandong Province(grant numbers:ZR2019MF073); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, China University of Petroleum (East China)(grant numbers:20CX05001A); Major Scientific and Technological Projects of CNPC(grant numbers:ZD2019-183-008); Creative Research Team of Young Scholars at Universities in Shandong Province(grant numbers:2019KJN019); State Key Laboratory of Shale Oil and Gas Enrichment Mechanisms and Effective Development(grant numbers:33550000-22-ZC0613-0243); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9964183","Object re-identification;non-contrastive;nearest neighbor;unsupervised learning","Training;Task analysis;Noise measurement;Cameras;Artificial neural networks;Visualization;Semantics","iterative methods;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern clustering;regression analysis;unsupervised learning","achieves state-of-the-art performance;class collision issue;clustering method;corrects class collision issues;false-negative samples;incorrect model optimization;large-scale person re-identification datasets;large-scale vehicle re-identification dataset;nearest neighbors;NNNI;noise instances;noncontrastive nearest neighbor identity-guided method;random identity sampler;re-identification tasks;self-paced contrastive learning;supervised methods;unsupervised object re-identification","","1","","56","IEEE","28 Nov 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Current studies cover spotlight on predicting flight delays using machine learning approaches. Most prior prediction processes are restricted to a sole direction or airport. One of the difficult situations in the business world, flight planning involves a lot of unpredictability. Such a circumstance exists when delays occur; they are caused by a variety of circumstances and come at a significant expense to airlines, operators, and passengers. Bad climate, regular and local holiday demands, airline policies, practical problem with airport communications, personal belongings management, and mechanistic paraphernalia, and the accumulation of interruption from earlier flights can all cause postponement in departure. Extended flight delay prediction tasks are designed to cover a wider variety of variables that could potentially involve the flight postponement, and they test numerous machine learning oriented models. Automatic dependent surveillance-broadcast (ADS-B) communication be obtained, preprocessed, along with pooled with further data, such as climate, airline information, and airport terminal information, to provide a dataset for the projected strategy. The planned prediction challenges include a regression task in addition to other classification tasks. Accurate estimation of flight delay is essential for airlines and results can used to increase customer satisfaction and revenue for airlines. We employed big data technology, specifically Hadoop, to more accurately estimate flight delays. In this system for predicting aircraft delays is dependent on aviation data, which may cause delays. The data is then run through regressions. The system takes into account a number of factors. The algorithms employed in this system include Random Forest (RF), K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) Linear Regression (LR), logistic regressions and Support Vector Machine (SVM).

Therefore, a variety of approaches have been developed in recent years on how to bring the design for additive manufacturing (DfAM) into university teaching. In a detailed literature review, the advantages and disadvantages of the previous approaches are considered and analysed. Based on this, an extended approach is presented in which students analyse and optimize a given product with respect to additive manufacturing. In doing so, the students have to solve challenging tasks in optimization in product development with the help of methodical approaches and practically implement their developed solutions with state-of-the-art additive processes. To work on this task, the students have two different 3D printers at their disposal, which work with different processes and materials. Thus, the students learn to adapt the design to different manufacturing processes and to consider the restrictions of different materials. The assessment of the results from this course is done through feedback and a written survey.","","978-1-6654-2488-2","10.1109/WEEF/GEDC53299.2021.9657413","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9657413","Design Education;Additive Manufacturing;workshop;evaluation;Design for AM","Three-dimensional displays;Manufacturing processes;Bibliographies;Three-dimensional printing;Product development;Printers;Automobiles","automobiles;computer aided instruction;educational courses;educational institutions;further education;nonlinear control systems;product development;rapid prototyping (industrial);teaching;vehicle dynamics","additive manufacturing;RC race car models;extended approach;methodical approaches;state-of-the-art additive processes;different manufacturing processes;design education","","","","20","IEEE","4 Jan 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Our method uses semantic dependencies and relative positions between nodes in the diagram to construct relation graphs and applies graph attention networks to learn diagram representations. To extract and reason over the multimodal knowledge, we first extract the text that is the most relevant to questions, options, and the instructional diagram which is the most relevant to question diagrams at the word-sentence level and the node-diagram level, respectively. Then, we apply instructional-diagram-guided attention and question-guided attention to reason over the node of question diagrams, respectively.

However, obtaining semantically annotated datasets for such tasks is an expensive affair. To alleviate this problem, this article presents a novel framework to model and understand the image dynamics by discovering latent information in Sentinel-1 SITS, even with limited ground truth data. The framework suggests how to use visualizations to efficiently integrate domain knowledge both for execution and evaluation of the machine-learning pipeline in the absence from ground truth data in SITS change studies. In a case study at a Polar region, we extend a limited amount of ground truth data and then discover its temporal evolution at image patch level, in an unsupervised manner. The trustworthiness of the framework is ensured by integration of domain knowledge and intelligent visual verification strategies. A visualization tool is also implemented for this purpose. The proposed framework contains two modules: a classifier and a change modeler. Our experiments show that a domain-knowledge-based classifier gives the best accuracy. The classifier semantically labeled the complete dataset of 24 study months, containing 153 600 patches with a size of 256 × 256 pixels by extending the available semantic labels from just three months. The temporal sequence of these sematic labels are then recorded and fed to a Bayesian model called Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to discover the underlying patterns. LDA generates a change map containing the dominant dynamic patterns to give a consolidated view of the evolution without having to browse the whole dataset. Further, color-coded change signatures explain the change classes.","2151-1535","","10.1109/JSTARS.2023.3273122","H2020 ExtremeEarth project(grant numbers:825258); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10127624","Change maps;color-coded change signatures;domain knowledge;Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA);satellite image time series (SITS);unsupervised;visualization","Semantics;Task analysis;Spatiotemporal phenomena;Data visualization;Time series analysis;Data mining;Classification algorithms","","","","","","25","CCBY","16 May 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Various consensus model subsets may benefit from the various blockchain mining techniques proposed by researchers. Most of these techniques, however, are rather complicated, which slows down the mining process for large-scale blockchains. Overly simplistic models that include unnecessary redundancies are inefficient and have little practical use. To solve these issues and boost blockchain mining efficiency in large-scale deployments, the authors of this paper propose creating a novel hybrid bioinspired approach. The proposed IP Network model is adaptable to almost all consensus procedures and may be easily combined with dynamic consensus models with few alterations. After collecting performance and context-specific data from the underlying blockchains, the technique uses Genetic Algorithm (GA) that distributes these range sets among miner nodes that support trust, allowing for high-performance mining while maintaining a high degree of trust under actual application situations. The model was tested against Proof-of-Stake (PoS), Proof-of-Work (PoW), Proof-of-Trust (PoT), and Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT) based consensus algorithms to ensure its effectiveness in real-world scenarios. Mining latency, energy consumption, and computational complexity were used as metrics against which this performance was measured. This analysis revealed that the proposed model has the potential to decrease mining latency by 4.5%, energy usage by 3.9%, and compute complexity by 4.1% across a variety of consensus mechanisms, making it suitable for a number of real-time applications.","2157-0485","979-8-3503-4842-2","10.1109/ICETET-SIP58143.2023.10151475","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10151475","IP;Networks;Blockchain;Mining;GA;Delay;Energy;Complexity;Consensus Network access security model.","Adaptation models;Analytical models;Biological system modeling;Computational modeling;Redundancy;Real-time systems;IP networks","","","","","","30","IEEE","19 Jun 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Efficient detection of tax evasion has always been a crucial issue for both governments and academic researchers. Recent research has proposed the use of machine learning technology to detect tax evasion and has shown good results in some specific areas. Regrettably, there are still two major obstacles to detect tax evasion. First, it is hard to extract powerful features because of the complexity of tax data. Second, due to the complicated process of tax auditing, labeled data are limited in practice. Such obstacles motivate the contributions of this work. In this paper, we propose a novel tax evasion detection framework named FBNE-PU (Fusion of the basic feature and network embedding with PU learning for tax evasion detection), a multistage method for detecting tax evasion in real-life scenarios. In this paper, we perform an in-depth analysis of the characteristics of the transaction network and propose a novel network embedding algorithm, the PnCGCN. It significantly improves detection performance by extracting powerful features from basic features and the tax-related transaction network. Moreover, we use nnPU (positive-unlabeled learning with non-negative risk estimator) to assign pseudo labels for unlabeled data. Finally, an MLP is trained as the decision function. Experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms the comparison methods in the tax evasion detection task.

This leads to several issues including wastage of time, additional fuel consumption, and green gas emissions. Optimization of traffic signals based on traffic behavior is widely explored topic in which vehicle detection and classification is one of the leading areas of research of Intelligent Transportation System (ITS). Among the technologies Artificial Intelligence (AI) has emerged as a giant in which vehicle classification has developed as a prominent subject of study because of its usefulness in several applications such as traffic control and surveillance, security systems, traffic congestion, avoidance, and accident prevention. Numerous algorithms and techniques for classifying vehicles have been proposed and implemented so far globally which mimics human intelligence. The goal of the paper is to familiarize the reader with the existing AI-based vehicle classification algorithms and to give a comparison of various vehicle detection and classification methods. The existing vehicle classification algorithms are summarized under two categories based on input type i.e., image or video.

This article proposes an attention-based convolutional recurrent neural network (ACRNN) to extract more discriminative features from EEG signals and improve the accuracy of emotion recognition. First, the proposed ACRNN adopts a channel-wise attention mechanism to adaptively assign the weights of different channels, and a CNN is employed to extract the spatial information of encoded EEG signals. Then, to explore the temporal information of EEG signals, extended self-attention is integrated into an RNN to recode the importance based on intrinsic similarity in EEG signals.

Given that evacuation is a checking process rather than a preselection process, evolutionary game theory can be used to better understand the crowd dynamics by analyzing the imitation effects in terms of individual interactions during evacuation. The key purpose of this paper was to construct an evolutionary game model of emergency evacuation of a teaching building at a university after an earthquake to search for the specific constraints necessary to reach the expected collective behaviors for orderly evacuation. We first analyzed the evacuation scenarios, including the environment of the teaching building, emergency degree of the earthquake and behaviors of the crowd. The related game players in the evacuation process were divided into three types, impulsive evacuees, calm evacuees and university staffs, and their payoff matrix was constructed according to the evacuation scenarios. Then, an evolutionary game model via the replicated dynamic system was created, and stable strategies were discussed. Next, we simulated eighteen evacuation scenarios with adjustment of the guiding authoritativeness, emergency degree, and group-oriented coefficient; the simulation results showed that the worst stable strategies can be avoided and the expected stable strategies can be obtained by adjusting the constraints, which are closely related to the corresponding management measures.

With the explosive growth of user terminals (UTs) and data traffic, the integration of massive multiple-input multiple-output (mMIMO) techniques and LEO satellite communication systems has been regarded as a novel idea to enhance system capacity and realize global seamless high-speed interconnection. However, obtaining effective downlink channel state information (CSI) and establishing a simple and efficient hybrid beamforming mechanism are challenging tasks due to the limitations of objective factors, such as high dynamic, long delay, and low payload in LEO satellite scenarios. It is embodied in three aspects: 1) the untenable channel reciprocity in time division duplex (TDD) systems; 2) the training feedback costs and feedback delay in frequency division duplex (FDD) systems; and 3) the complex nonconvex optimization process faced by hybrid beamforming design. Driven by the performance advantages of the deep learning (DL) technology to deal with various problems in the field of physical layer communications, this article proposes to use a deep neural network (DNN) to solve the above challenges, and constructs SatCP and SatHB schemes for realizing downlink CSI acquirement and hybrid beamforming design, respectively. By deeply mining the potential correlation of the uplink-downlink channels between LEO satellites and UTs and exploring the mapping relationship between CSI and beamformers, the SatCP can assist LEO satellites to directly predict the future downlink CSI based on the observed uplink CSI with no need for downlink channel estimation, while the SatHB can easily generate the corresponding beamformers based on the downlink CSI predicted by the SatCP without requiring complex optimization. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed SatCP and SatHB can play an effective auxiliary role in LEO satellite mMIMO communication systems.","2327-4662","","10.1109/JIOT.2022.3190412","National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2018YFB1801103); Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province of China(grant numbers:BK20192002); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61671476,61901516,62171466); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9826890","Channel prediction;deep learning (DL);hybrid beamforming;low-Earth orbit (LEO) satellite;massive multiple-input multiple-output (mMIMO)","Low earth orbit satellites;Satellites;Array signal processing;Downlink;Satellite broadcasting;Radio frequency;Communication systems","array signal processing;channel capacity;channel estimation;concave programming;deep learning (artificial intelligence);frequency division multiplexing;MIMO communication;satellite communication;telecommunication computing;telecommunication traffic;time division multiplexing;wireless channels","channel reciprocity;deep learning technology;deep neural network;downlink channel estimation;FDD systems;frequency division duplex systems;high-speed interconnection;hybrid beamforming design;Internet of Things services;IoT services;LEO satellite massive MIMO system;LEO satellite mMIMO communication systems;low-Earth orbit satellites;nonconvex optimization process;TDD systems;time division duplex systems;uplink-downlink channel state information;uplink-downlink CSI","","2","","43","IEEE","12 Jul 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We use the semantic enhancement module (SEM) in the ventral pathway network to fuse information of different scales to enhance the extraction of semantic information, and we use the spatial attention module (SAM) in the dorsal pathway network to assign weights to different locations in space to enhance the extraction of spatial information. By fusing the information of the two pathways, the final semantic segmentation result is obtained. Since the dorsal pathway network is used to specifically enhance the extraction of spatial information, the problem of spatial information loss during the segmentation process is effectively improved, and higher segmentation accuracy can be achieved by using only a small backbone network.

Local Differential Privacy (LDP)-based data collection is a promising technology to protect sensitive information. A mobile device modify data to make each piece of data indistinguishable from others but keep its intrinsic value for statistical characteristics in data. Although LDP fundamentally protects the privacy exposure from a data store, a datastore suffer a shortcomings on it; as a datastore can never validate the modified data due to concealed raw data, that allows anyone to tamper with one’s data or inject any amount of data, and thus manipulate the statistics of the whole data in a datastore, called data poisoning attack. As a device does not disclose raw data and a datastore cannot collaborate to validate data with a device who may be an adversary on this mutual distrust relationship, data collection needs an ability to avoid the effect of data poisoning.. The cause of data poisoning is the direct relationship between data volume and statistic; the more data a device sends gives more statistical changes on merged data in a datastore. In this paper, we propose to decouple statistical characteristics from data volumes on LDP-based data collection process to minimize the effect of poisoned data on a datastore. We utilize Oblivious Transfer (OT) protocol to retrieve only statistic characteristics of receiving data at a datastore. As OT protocol inevitably strengthen privacy protection on LDP-based data collection and accordingly drops statistic characteristics of data, We adjust LDP processing to collaboratively work with OT protocol. The proposed adjustment method adapts the protection strength of LDP to OT protocol behavior so that a data store receives data containing sufficient statistical characteristics. We conduct qualitative and experimental overhead analysis and show that our method decouples the relationship between statistical characteristics from data volume. Our experimental result also prove that the overhead can be acceptable on devices such as smartphones and IoT.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3251560","Information-Technology Promotion Agency (IPA)’s Industrial Cyber Security Centre of Excellence (ICS-CoE) Core Human Resources Development Program; Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS)’s KAKENHI(grant numbers:JP22J23910); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10057407","Local differential privacy;oblivious transfer protocol;location data;privacy-preserving data mining;data security","Protocols;Data collection;Privacy;Perturbation methods;Proposals;Differential privacy;Receivers;Location awareness;Data security","computer network security;data privacy;Internet of Things;mobile computing;smart phones","called data poisoning attack;concealed raw data;data store;data volume;datastore;LDP-based data collection process;Local Differential Privacy-based data collection;location data;merged data;modified data;Oblivious statistic collection;poisoned data;statistic characteristics;sufficient statistical characteristics","","","","37","CCBYNCND","2 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Although deep neural networks (DNNs) for the FAS task have achieved promising results in intra-dataset experiments with similar distributions of training and testing data, the DNNs’ generalization ability is limited under the cross-domain scenarios with different distributions of training and testing data. To improve the generalization ability, recent hybrid methods have been explored to extract task-aware handcrafted features (e.g., Local Binary Pattern) as discriminative information for the input of DNNs. However, the handcrafted feature extraction relies on experts’ domain knowledge, and how to choose appropriate handcrafted features is underexplored. To this end, we propose a learnable network to extract Meta Pattern (MP) in our learning-to-learn framework. By replacing handcrafted features with the MP, the discriminative information from MP is capable of learning a more generalized model. Moreover, we devise a two-stream network to hierarchically fuse the input RGB image and the extracted MP by using our proposed Hierarchical Fusion Module (HFM). We conduct comprehensive experiments and show that our MP outperforms the compared handcrafted features.

It is a critical component in Knowledge Graph (KG) for link prediction and knowledge discovery. Many works focus on designing proper score function for KGE, while the study of loss function has attracted relatively less attention. In this paper, we focus on improving the loss function when learning KGE. Specifically, we find that the frequently used margin-based loss in KGE models seeks to maximize the gap between the true facts score fp and the false facts score fn and only cares about the relative order of scores. Since its optimization objective is fp - fn = m, increasing fp is equivalent to decreasing fn. Its optimization objective creates an ambiguous convergence status which impairs the separability of positive and negative facts in embedding space. Inspired by the circle loss that offers a more flexible optimization manner with definite convergence targets and is widely used in computer vision tasks, we further extend it into the KGE model with the presented Batch Circle Loss (BCL). BCL allows multiple positives to be considered per anchor (h, r) (or (r, t)) in addition to multiple negatives (as opposed to a single positive sample as used before in KGE models). By comparing with other approaches, the obtained KGE models using our proposed loss function and training method shows superior performance.","2161-4407","978-1-7281-8671-9","10.1109/IJCNN55064.2022.9892213","National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2017yfa0700800); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9892213","knowledge graph embedding;link prediction;loss function","Training;Computer vision;Computational modeling;Neural networks;Predictive models;Knowledge discovery;Task analysis","computer vision;data mining;graph theory;learning (artificial intelligence)","knowledge discovery;proper score function;loss function;relatively less attention;learning KGE;frequently used margin-based loss;KGE model;false facts;optimization objective;positive facts;negative facts;embedding space;presented Batch Circle Loss;Knowledge Graph Embedding;low-dimension representations;knowledge graphs;link prediction","","","","23","IEEE","30 Sep 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In particular, the convolutional neural network (CNN) based methods have progressed. However, due to the high dimensionality of HSI and equal treatment of all bands, the performances of CNN based methods are hampered. The labels of land-covers often differ between edge and the center pixels in pixel-centered spatial information. These edge pixels may weaken the discrimination of spatial features and reduce classification accuracy. Motivated by the attention mechanism of the human visual system, the spatial proximity feature selection with residual spatial–spectral attention network is proposed in this article. It contains a residual spatial attention module, a residual spectral attention module, and a spatial proximity feature selection module. The residual spatial attention module aims to select the crucial spatial information, which assigns weights to different features by measuring the similarity between the surrounding elements and their central ones. The residual spectral attention module is designed for spectral bands which are selected from raw input data by emphasizing the valuable bands and suppressing the valueless. According to the spatial distribution of features, the spatial proximity feature selection module is used to filter features effectively.

NRL, also known as network embedding, aims at preserving graph structures in a low-dimensional space. These learned representations can be used for subsequent machine learning tasks, such as vertex classification, link prediction, and data visualization. Recently, graph convolutional network (GCN)-based models, e.g., GraphSAGE, have drawn a lot of attention for their success in inductive NRL. When conducting unsupervised learning on large-scale graphs, some of these models employ negative sampling (NS) for optimization, which encourages a target vertex to be close to its neighbors while being far from its negative samples. However, NS draws negative vertices through a random pattern or based on the degrees of vertices. Thus, the generated samples could be either highly relevant or completely unrelated to the target vertex. Moreover, as the training goes, the gradient of NS objective calculated with the inner product of the unrelated negative samples and the target vertex may become zero, which will lead to learning inferior representations. To address these problems, we propose an adversarial training method tailored for unsupervised inductive NRL on large networks. For efficiently keeping track of high-quality negative samples, we design a caching scheme with sampling and updating strategies that has a wide exploration of vertex proximity while considering training costs. Besides, the proposed method is adaptive to various existing GCN-based models without significantly complicating their optimization process. Extensive experiments show that our proposed method can achieve better performance compared with the state-of-the-art models.","2162-2388","","10.1109/TNNLS.2021.3084195","National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2019YFB1600704); Science and Technology Development Fund, Macau, SAR(grant numbers:FDCT/0068/2020/AGJ,FDCT/0045/2019/A1); Key-Area Research and Development Program of Guangdong Province(grant numbers:2019B111103001); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:U2001207,61872248,61902249,61876065); Guangdong “Pearl River Talent Recruitment Program”(grant numbers:2019ZT08X603); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9451538","Adversarial learning;graph neural network;inductive learning;negative sampling (NS);network embedding","Generators;Adaptation models;Adversarial machine learning;Computer science;Computational modeling;Probabilistic logic","data mining;data visualisation;graph theory;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;pattern clustering;unsupervised learning","adversarial caching training;adversarial training method;conducting unsupervised learning;data mining research;data visualization;existing GCN-based models;graph convolutional network-based models;graph structures;high-quality negative samples;inferior representations;large-scale graphs;learned representations;link prediction;low-dimensional space;negative sampling;negative vertices;network embedding;real-world applications;subsequent machine learning tasks;target vertex;training costs;unrelated negative samples;unsupervised inductive network representation learning;unsupervised inductive NRL;updating strategies;vertex classification;vertex proximity","","2","","32","IEEE","10 Jun 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Much of the IDT literature has focused on formal educational environments and not on nonformal settings outside the classroom and beyond formal education. Further analysis of tacit or practical knowledge exchanged among community members is required to understand the purpose, functions, and organizational knowledge capital in online CoPs. To fill this gap, this study uses natural language processing (NLP) to analyze the practical knowledge of 6,066 anonymized users’ posts from four large public IDT CoPs on Facebook from September 2017 to September 2020 after cleaning the dataset. User posts were publicly available and required no password authentication for access, including Instructional Designer (4,717), Designers for Learning (228), Adobe Captivate Users (599), and Articulate Storyline (522). The proposed methodology aims to extract practical knowledge of individual online CoPs in three parts. First, the characteristics of written communication among members are extracted by calculating word and sentence lengths, word frequencies, and contiguous words. Second, the characteristics of members’ exchange of practical knowledge are obtained through sentiment identification, entity recognition, and relationships between pedagogical and educational technology entities. Third, the functions of individual online CoPs are developed through topic modeling with latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) and BERTopic. The findings suggest similarities and differences among IDT CoPs, different resource distribution conventions, and members exchanging pedagogical and educational technology advice. The study highlights the need for pedagogical foundations to support instructional and technical decisions, mechanisms for self-assessment of practical knowledge concerning IDT competencies, community protocols for addressing misconceptions about learning, onboarding materials for new members, and new topic structures to classify practical knowledge.

However, conventional segmentation methods tend to have low accuracy and slow inference speed. Therefore, we propose a novel, precise, and fast segmentation scheme for offshore farms in high-resolution SAR images based on model fusion and half-precision parallel inference. Specifically, we propose several new high-performance improved UNet++ methods and reasonably fuse the test results. At the same time, a simulated annealing strategy and a morphological closing operation are introduced to improve the segmentation accuracy. In addition, we find that resizing the images to 256 × 256 pixels is better than 512 × 512 pixels for this task, which not only has higher segmentation accuracy but can also increase the inference speed by nearly 13%. Furthermore, a novel half-precision parallel inference strategy is proposed, which can fully utilize the GPU and increase the inference speed by 72.6%. Compared with some state-of-the-art methods, the proposed scheme that merges two improved UNet++ achieves superior accuracy with a frequency weighted intersection over union of 0.9876 and a single image inference time of 0.0218 s on the high-resolution SAR offshore farm dataset.","2151-1535","","10.1109/JSTARS.2022.3181355","Innovation Project of Equipment Development Department–Information Perception Technology(grant numbers:E01Z040601); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9793701","Half-precision parallel inference;improved UNET++;SAR images;segmentation;simulated annealing","Image segmentation;Feature extraction;Task analysis;Radar polarimetry;Licenses;Simulated annealing;Data mining","aquaculture;image segmentation;radar imaging;simulated annealing;synthetic aperture radar","high-resolution SAR images;model fusion;high-resolution synthetic aperture radar images;segment offshore farms;reasonable layout;statistics;conventional segmentation methods;slow inference speed;precise, segmentation scheme;fast segmentation scheme;half-precision parallel inference strategy;single image inference time;high-resolution SAR offshore farm dataset;time 0.0218 s","","","","66","CCBYNCND","10 Jun 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Most existing convolutional neural network (CNN)-based methods adopt an early/late fusion strategy to fuse the low-/high-level features for classification, which still has two inherent challenges: 1) the conventional convolution operation performs a weighted average operation on each pixel in the receptive field, which will reduce the discriminability of the center pixel due to the influence of the interference pixels and 2) the spatial–spectral features of the hyperspectral image (HSI), the elevation features of light detection and ranging (LiDAR), and the complementary features between the multimodal data are not fully exploited, which results in the reduction of classification accuracy. In this article, an effective multibranch feature fusion network with self- and cross-guided attention (MB2FscgaNet) is proposed for the joint classification of LiDAR and HSI. The main concern of this article is how to accurately estimate more effective spectral–spatial-elevation features and yield more effective transfer in the network. Specifically, MB2FscgaNet adopts a multibranch feature fusion architecture to fully exploit the hierarchical features from LiDAR and HSI level by level. At each level of the network, a self- and cross-guided attention (SCGA) is developed to assign a higher weight to interesting areas and channels of LiDAR and HSI feature maps to obtain refined spectral–spatial-elevation features and provide complementary information cross-guidance between LiDAR and HS. We further designed a spectral supplement module (SeSuM) to improve the discriminative ability of the center pixel. Comparative classification results and ablation studies demonstrate that the proposed MB2FscgaNet achieves competitive performance against state-of-the-art methods.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2022.3179737","National Defense Pre-Research Foundation; Higher Education Discipline Innovation Project(grant numbers:B08038); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62101414); Natural Science Basic Research Plan in Shaanxi Province of China(grant numbers:2021JQ-194,2021JQ-197); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(grant numbers:XJS210108,XJS210104); China Post-Doctoral Science Foundation(grant numbers:2021M702546,2021M702548); Scientific and Technological Activities for Overseas Students of Shaanxi Province(grant numbers:2020-017); Basic and Applied Basic Research Foundation of Guangdong Province(grant numbers:2020A1515110856); Yangtze River Scholar Bonus Schemes of China(grant numbers:CJT160102); Ten Thousand Talent Program; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9790044","Hyperspectral image (HSI);joint classification;light detection and ranging (LiDAR);self- and cross-guided attention (SCGA)","Feature extraction;Laser radar;Data mining;Task analysis;Fuses;Principal component analysis;Hyperspectral imaging","convolutional neural nets;geophysical image processing;geophysical techniques;hyperspectral imaging;image classification;land cover;optical radar","multisource data;land cover classification;convolutional neural network-based methods;weighted average operation;interference pixels;hyperspectral image;complementary features;multimodal data;classification accuracy;multibranch feature fusion network;multibranch feature fusion architecture;hierarchical features;HSI level;complementary information cross-guidance;spectral supplement module;MB2FscgaNet;refined spectral-spatial-elevation features;lidar classification;CNN;light detection and ranging;self- and cross-guided attention;SCGA;SeSuM","","5","","38","IEEE","7 Jun 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, the present transfer learning-based methods usually transfer knowledge from a single source domain, such as the natural image domain. Therefore, these methods cannot simultaneously transfer spectral and spatial knowledge to the target domain in HSIs. Generally, the natural image has rich spatial structure and texture information, while the HSI has abundant spectral information. To better utilize the knowledge learned from natural image datasets and HSI datasets, we proposed a multimodal transfer feature fusion network (MTFFN) for HSI classification. In MTFFN, a dual-branch network structure is designed to transfer the two-modal knowledge from the natural image domain and the source HSI domain to the target domain in two branches, respectively. A multitask learning strategy is adopted to achieve feature fusion. The fused features are used to generate the final classification result. Moreover, a local attention mechanism is designed to extract more meaningful spectral features.

However, they have the deficiency of insufficient contextual information aggregation, thus resulting in false and missed detections, and it is difficult to refine the detection of change edges. To alleviate these problems and obtain more accurate results, we propose an efficient self-weighted spatial–temporal attention network (SSANet). In contrast to the Siamese structure, our network is a novel joint learning framework composed of fusion subnetwork, difference subnetwork, and decoder. Fusion subnetwork is used to extract multiscale object features where we propose a multicore channel-aligning attention (MCA) module to capture the long-range semantic information for multiscale context aggregation. Difference subnetwork is used to extract the difference variation features, where we propose a feature differential reconfiguration (FDR) module to learn the temporal change information. FDR can effectively filter change information and reconstruct features to improve the perception of changed regions. To better balance the MCA and FDR modules, an asymmetric weighting (AW) module is proposed in the decoder to self-weight the multiscale features and generate the change map.

Consequently, digital transformation has emerged as a key priority for organisations to effectively adopt rapidly evolving technology. Digital transformation requires many stakeholders working together to achieve a common objective of supporting the organisation through a fundamental change. Managing the stakeholders is then a critical challenge in the process. Stakeholders often have different viewpoints, which can be a potent opportunity for tapping into their shared collective intelligence to develop new ideas and solutions. However, successfully incorporating these diverse perspectives and also preserving emergent behaviour is a demanding task since no methodology currently exists to support such integration. This paper proposes a System of Systems approach to stakeholder management in digital transformation, where each stakeholder is recognized as an individual, autonomous, decentralized, and heterogeneous system with its own set of attributes while simultaneously being part of a larger collective whole, or SoS. By considering each stakeholder as a system within a greater SoS, emergent behaviour that is created through stakeholder interaction can be fostered and reinforced. Since the whole is greater than the sum of its parts, emergence generated as part of a collective interface of relevant stakeholders enables more holistic stakeholder integration and contributes to more effective governance.","","978-1-6654-9623-0","10.1109/SOSE55472.2022.9812667","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9812667","System of Systems;Digital Transformation;Stakeholders;Stakeholder Management;Collective Intelligence","Stakeholders;Feedback loop;System of systems;Digital transformation;Globalization;Collective intelligence;Complexity theory;Economics;Biological system modeling;Digital systems;Production planning","Internet;organisational aspects;project management","stakeholder management;digital transformation;geopolitical instability changes;COVID-19 pandemic;organisation;heterogeneous system;stakeholder interaction;holistic stakeholder integration;system of systems approach;SoS","","","","57","IEEE","6 Jul 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Secondly, a syntactic-based post-processing is designed to check the labelled results and form the phrases related to the context of use. Finally, the customers’ preferences related to the contexts of use is analysed by studying and aggregating it with its relevant hedonic quality (such as positive or negative) which can then be used to enrich the UX modelling.

The key of this task is to accurately measure similarity between these two modalities. Prior work measuring this similarity mainly based on matched fragments (i.e., word/region with high relevance), while underestimating or even ignoring the effect of mismatched fragments (i.e., word/region with low relevance), e.g., via a typical LeaklyReLU or ReLU operation that forces negative scores close or exact to zero in attention. This work argues that mismatched textual fragments, which contain rich mismatching clues, are also crucial for image-text matching. We thereby propose a novel Negative-Aware Attention Framework (NAAF), which explicitly exploits both the positive effect of matched fragments and the negative effect of mismatched fragments to jointly infer image-text similarity. NAAF (1) delicately designs an iterative optimization method to maximally mine the mismatched fragments, facilitating more discriminative and robust negative effects, and (2) devises the two-branch matching mechanism to precisely calculate similarity/dissimilarity degrees for matched/mismatched fragments with different masks. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets, i.e., Flickr30K and MSCOCO, demonstrate the superior effectiveness of our NAAF, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

Three-dimensional augmented reality (3D-AR) is an emerging technology that has the potential to assist physicians with spatial reasoning during clinical interventions. The most intriguing applications of 3D-AR involve visualizations of anatomy or surgical plans that appear directly on the patient. However, commercially available 3D-AR devices have spatial localization errors that are too large for many clinical procedures. For this reason, a variety of approaches for improving 3D-AR registration accuracy have been explored. The focus of this review is on the methods, accuracy, and clinical applications of registering 3D-AR devices with the clinical environment. The works cited represent a variety of approaches for registering holograms to patients, including manual registration, computer vision-based registration, and registrations that incorporate external tracking systems. Evaluations of user accuracy when performing clinically relevant tasks suggest that accuracies of approximately 2 mm are feasible. 3D-AR device limitations due to the vergence-accommodation conflict or other factors attributable to the headset hardware add on the order of 1.5 mm of error compared to conventional guidance.

However, in order to obtain a better counting performance, most of the existing works often design larger and more complex network structures, which will result in them occupying considerable memory, time and other resources at runtime, seriously limiting their deployment scope and making it difficult to be widely used in practical scenarios. In this paper, in order to overcome the above problems, we propose an effective lightweight encoding-decoding crowd counting network, named Lw-Count. Specifically, in the encoding process, we design an efficient and lightweight convolution module (ELCM), which extracts the crowd features in the network through a refined ghost block to reduce the network parameters and computing cost, and solves the problem of inaccurate counting caused by uneven crowd distribution through spatial group normalization (SGN).

Deep unfolding methods have been studied in recent years to bridge the gap between optimization-based and learning-based methods. However, these unfolding methods usually ignore the utilization of intermediate network features between different iteration stages, thereby limiting the performance of super-resolution results. We propose a multi-source information fusion network (MSFNet) for ORSI super-resolution to address this problem. We mainly consider three strategies to enhance the image super-resolution performance, including feature extraction strategy, information fusion strategy, and the structure of the unfolding network. Firstly, image information of various scales is helpful for mining potential features of images for image super-resolution. Therefore, we introduce multi-scale implicit constraints to the objective function. Secondly, we unfold the optimization process into a neural network by alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). This unfolding strategy can effectively utilize the prior information for image reconstruction. Thirdly, we propose a row-column decoupling Transformer module for feature fusion. Specifically, the row Transformer block completes the feature fusion of various scales, and the column Transformer block completes the feature fusion of various channels. The fused features are transmitted to the next iteration stage for feature enhancement. We perform experiments on three remote sensing image datasets to fully demonstrate the algorithm's effectiveness.

However, a more recent trend is to perform defect prediction for a single or consecutive commits to the repository, which is known as just-in-time (JIT) defect prediction. JIT defect prediction finds error-prone changes instead of error-prone modules, and as a result, the developer only needs to investigate error-prone changed lines instead of the entire module. When building JIT defect prediction models, researchers used various metrics, including developer experience metrics which measure the developer’s experiences. Despite the fact that software defectiveness is likely to be affected by the experience of developers, developer metrics were understudied in the literature. In this work, we investigate the impact of various novel developer experience metrics and their combinations on JIT defect prediction. Our experimental results are positive.

Recently, deep neural networks have achieved impressive performance in this area, especially pretrained language models (PLMs). Usually, these methods concentrate on input sentences and corresponding semantic embedding generation. However, for another essential component: labels, most existing works either treat them as meaningless one-hot vectors or use vanilla embedding methods to learn label representations along with model training, underestimating the semantic information and guidance that these labels reveal. To alleviate this problem and better exploit label information, in this article, we employ self-supervised learning (SSL) in model learning process and design a novel self-supervised relation of relation (R $^2$ ) classification task for label utilization from a one-hot manner perspective. Then, we propose a novel () for text classification, in which text classification and R $^2$  classification are treated as optimization targets. Meanwhile, triplet loss is employed to enhance the analysis of differences and connections among labels. Moreover, considering that one-hot usage is still short of exploiting label information, we incorporate external knowledge from WordNet to obtain multiaspect descriptions for label semantic learning and extend to a novel () from a label embedding perspective. One step further, since these fine-grained descriptions may introduce unexpected noise, we develop a mutual interaction module to select appropriate parts from input sentences and labels simultaneously based on contrastive learning (CL) for noise mitigation. Extensive experiments on different text classification tasks reveal that can effectively improve the classification performance and can make better use of label information and further improve the performance. As a byproduct, we have released the codes to facilitate other research.","2162-2388","","10.1109/TNNLS.2023.3282020","Young Scientists Fund of the National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62006066); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61727809,61922073,72188101); joint Funds of the National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:U22A2094); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(grant numbers:JZ2021HGTB0075); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10154259","Contrastive learning (CL);label embedding;representation learning;text classification","Semantics;Text categorization;Task analysis;Encoding;Training;Electronic mail;Business","","","","","","","IEEE","16 Jun 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

To ensure the quality of esports game services and establish a balanced gaming environment, it is essential to consider the opinions of unprofessional players and comprehensively analyze their reviews. This study proposes a new framework for analyzing esports reviews of players. It incorporates two key components: topic modeling and sentiment analysis. Utilizing the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) algorithm, the framework effectively identifies diverse topics within reviews.

We evaluated the performance of the MABC on standard benchmark instances and compared it with several state-of-the-art algorithms, including RLS, ALMMKP, ACO, PEGF-PERC, TIKS-TIKS2 and D-QPSO. The experimental results reveal that MABC produces highly competitive solutions in terms of the best solutions found, achieving approximately 2% of the optimal solutions with trivial (milliseconds) CPU time. The Kruskal-Wallis test revealed that there was no statistically significant difference in the objective function values between the MABC algorithm and other state-of-the-art algorithms (H = 0.31506, p = 0.98882). However, for CPU efficiency, the test showed a statistically significant difference (H = 84.90850, p = 0), indicating that the MABC algorithm exhibited significantly better CPU efficiency (with shorter execution times) than the other algorithms did.

Given a document of any domains, the model needs to figure out the sentiments with respect to fine-grained aspects in the documents. Two main challenges exist in this problem. One is to build a robust document modeling across domains; the other is to mine the domain-specific aspects and make use of the sentiment lexicon. In this paper, we propose a novel approach Neural Attentive model for cross-domain Aspect-level sentiment CLassification (NAACL), which leverages the benefits of the supervised deep neural network as well as the unsupervised probabilistic generative model to strengthen the representation learning. NAACL jointly learns two tasks: (i) a domain classifier, working on documents in both the source and target domains to recognize the domain information of input texts and transfer knowledge from the source domain to the target domain. In particular, a weakly supervised Latent Dirichlet Allocation model (wsLDA) is proposed to learn the domain-specific aspect and sentiment lexicon representations that are then used to calculate the aspect/lexicon-aware document representations via a multi-view attention mechanism; (ii) an aspect-level sentiment classifier, sharing the document modeling with the domain classifier. It makes use of the domain classification results and the aspect/sentiment-aware document representations to classify the aspect-level sentiment of the document in domain adaptation scenario. NAACL is evaluated on both English and Chinese datasets with the out-of-domain as well as in-domain setups. Quantitatively, the experiments demonstrate that NAACL has robust superiority over the compared methods in terms of classification accuracy and F1 score. The qualitative evaluation also shows that the proposed model is capable of reasonably paying attention to those words that are important to judge the sentiment polarity of the input text given an aspect.","1949-3045","","10.1109/TAFFC.2019.2897093","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61803249); Shanghai Sailing Program(grant numbers:18YF1407700); Shenzhen Institutes of Advanced Technology Innovation Program for Excellent Young Researchers(grant numbers:Y8G027); CAS Pioneer Hundred Talents Program(grant numbers:Y84402); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8632754","Aspect-level sentiment classification;domain adaptation;topic modeling;multi-view attention","Adaptation models;Neural networks;Task analysis;Computational modeling;Probabilistic logic;Social networking (online);Semantics","learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;pattern classification;sentiment analysis;word processing","in-domain setups;domain classification results;aspect-level sentiment classifier;sentiment lexicon representations;weakly supervised Latent Dirichlet Allocation model;target domain;source domain;domain information;domain classifier;supervised deep neural network;NAACL;cross-domain Aspect-level sentiment CLassification;neural attentive model;domain-specific aspect;fine-grained aspects;domain adaptation scenario;cross-domain Aspect-level sentiment classification","","11","","63","IEEE","1 Feb 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The method can eliminate the problem of insufficient feature extraction and more redundancy within the RandLA-Net model, and achieve efficient recognition of the street trees. As an application of street tree recognition results, we studied the accurate calculation method of street tree shading area and designed a density-based iterative  $\alpha $ -shape algorithm. The method effectively solves the problems of large density differences among different point sets and overestimation of shading area caused by the existing convex hull algorithms’ unrefined contour reconstruction, and improves the calculation accuracy of the canopy shading area. Experiments on the Paris-Lille-3D dataset show that the improved RandLA-Net network improves the IoU of three classes by 3.19%~6.46% and reduces the model complexity by 1.4% compared to the original model. The density-based iterative  $\alpha $ -shape algorithm achieves more refined contour reconstruction and solves the overestimation of shading area by 26% and 9% due to the other two convex hull algorithms.

This work is aimed to tackle these problems and remove redundant and irrelevant features to improve the generalization properties of the classifier. In other words, the selection of a qualitative and discriminative set of features, aiming to reduce dimensionality that helps to achieve a successful pattern classification. In this work, we use a biologically inspired genetic algorithm because crossover employed in such algorithm significantly improve the quality of multimodal discriminative set of features and hence improve the classification accuracy for diversified natural scene text images. The Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm is used for classification and the average F-Score is used as fitness function and target condition. First after preprocessing input images, the whole feature space (population) is built using a multimodal feature representation technique.

To better extract such features from the vehicle image to improve the recognition accuracy, we propose a three-branch adaptive attention network—Global Relational Attention and Multi-granularity Feature Learning (GRMF) to improve feature representation and discrimination. First, we divide the network into three branches, extracting different and useful features from three perspectives: spatial location, channel information, and local information. Second, we propose two effective global relational attention modules, which capture the global structural information for better attention learning. Specifically, to determine the importance level of a node, we use the global relationship between the node and all other nodes to infer the attention weight of the node directly. Third, according to the characteristics of the vehicle re-identification task, we introduce a suitable local partition strategy. It not only can simply capture subtle local information but also solve the problem of misalignment and within-part consistency disruption to a great extent.

Some recent works have been proposed to estimate the intrinsic components using encoder-decoder structures. However, they generally lack exploration of the different component-oriented feature constraints and feature selection processes. In this paper, a non-local color compensation network (NCCNet) is proposed. Firstly, the hue and value channels of HSV color space are used as the complementary information for RGB images for the estimation of albedo and shading, respectively. The color space representation serves as an external constraint, which does not require expensive sensors or complicated computations. Secondly, an integrated non-local attention scheme is proposed to describe the relations of non-adjacent regions with a lower computational complexity compared to traditional methods. Then the non-local and local attention are combined to describe correlations among features and used as feature selectors between the encoder and decoder. Thirdly, the mutual constraint between albedo and shading is also explored in the network to further optimize the process. In order to train the network, a unified mutual exclusion loss function is proposed. Extensive experiments are conducted on several popular datasets, and the proposed NCCNet achieves improved performance with comparable computational cost compared to competing methods.","1558-2205","","10.1109/TCSVT.2022.3199428","Key Research and Development Projects of Shaanxi Province(grant numbers:2021ZDLGY15-01,2021ZDLGY09-04,2021GY-004,2022ZDLGY06-07); Shenzhen International Science and Technology Cooperation(grant numbers:GJHZ20200731095204013); Business Finland project AMALIA; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9858179","Intrinsic image decomposition;color compensation;multi-scale attention;mutual constraint","Image color analysis;Feature extraction;Image decomposition;Image reconstruction;Lighting;Task analysis;Decoding","feature extraction;feature selection;image colour analysis;image representation;neural nets;optimisation","albedo;color space representation;encoder-decoder structures;feature constraints;feature selection;HSV color space;intrinsic components;NCCNet;nonadjacent regions;nonlocal attention scheme;nonlocal color compensation network;RGB images;shading;single image-based intrinsic image decomposition;unified mutual exclusion loss function","","","","63","IEEE","17 Aug 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Previous studies have pointed out that qualitative constraint networks often contain redundant constraints. This not only results in a waste of storage and transmission resources, but can also be a bottleneck in various algorithms and applications that are based on qualitative constraint networks. Existing research proposed several algorithms to deal with redundant constraints, but their time complexities are relatively high, which is very unfavorable when dealing with large-scale data that are common nowadays. This paper proposes a new model based on distributed computation to deal with redundant constraints efficiently. Specifically, this paper theoretically proves the feasibility of the distributed model for this problem, proposes different optimization algorithms for distributed task allocation, and evaluates the performance of the distributed model through a variety of experiments on real-world data sets. The results show that the distributed model can significantly improve the processing efficiency of simplifying representations of qualitative spatio-temporal information on large-scale data sets, and that the distributed solution to the problem of simplifying representations can also improve data privacy, which can contribute to big data processing and data security protection in qualitative spatiotemporal reasoning research.","","978-1-6654-0553-9","10.1109/ISKE54062.2021.9755336","National Natural Science Foundation of China; Research and Development; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9755336","qualitative spatio-temporal representation and reasoning;qualitative constraint network;representation simplification;redundancy;distributed algorithm","Knowledge engineering;Computational modeling;Redundancy;Distributed databases;Data models;Cognition;Spatiotemporal phenomena","artificial intelligence;Big Data;computational complexity;data mining;data privacy;inference mechanisms;optimisation;security of data;spatial reasoning;spatiotemporal phenomena;temporal reasoning","large-scale qualitative spatio-temporal constraint redundancy removal;qualitative spatio-temporal representation;qualitative constraint networks;spatio-temporal knowledge;redundant constraints;distributed model;qualitative spatio-temporal information;qualitative spatiotemporal reasoning research","","","","33","IEEE","18 Apr 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Multi-view multi-label learning inevitably has the problems of consistency, diversity, and non-alignment among views and the correlation among labels. Most of the existing multi-view multi-label methods for non-aligned views assume that each view has a common or shared label set, but because a single view cannot contain the entire label information, they often learn suboptimal results. Based on this, this paper proposes a non-aligned multi-view multi-label classification method that learns view-specific labels (LVSL), aiming to explicitly mine the information of view-specific labels and low-rank label structures in non-aligned views in a unified model framework. Furthermore, to alleviate insufficient available label information, we thoroughly explored the global and local structural information among labels. Specifically, first, we assume that there is structural consistency between the view and the label space and then construct the view-specific label model in turn. Second, to enrich the original label space information, we mine the consistent information of multiple views and the low-rank correlation information hidden among multiple labels. Finally, the contribution weight of each view is combined with learning the complementary information among the views in the decision-making stage, and extend the model to handle nonlinear data.

Spatial information is essential for grass resource management in pastoral areas, which can be extracted quickly on a large-scale by using remote sensing data. However, most conventional methods are based on the grid pixels of remote sensing images. The spatial information based on these regular units inevitably has the phenomenon of mixed pixels, which leads to the unreliability of grassland resource information with irregular spatial heterogeneity. To resolve this problem, this article takes the spatial mapping of fractional vegetation cover (FVC) as a typical target task of information extraction of grassland resources and proposes a geoparcel-based spatial prediction method in which irregular geographic objects from high spatial resolution remote sensing images, i.e., grassland geoparcels, are used as basic mapping units instead of traditional regular units. This change can make the spatial expression of mapping closer to the reality of grassland due to the fine spatial structure. Moreover, multisource spatial data can be integrated together in the regression-based procedure of prediction through the geoparcel as a unified spatial benchmark. A case experiment of Abag Banner, Inner Mongolia, China, shows that the proposed method can achieve good FVC mapping results. The spatial prediction of FVC based on grassland geoparcels is verified to be effective when a random forest regression is used in the modeling. In comparison with traditional regular grid-based methods, the proposed method achieves higher accuracy with 11.89% in relative root mean squared error (%RMSE), and 0.86 in determination coefficient of regression (R2). It has advantages in sensing the tiny spatial heterogeneity of FVC at the boundary of grassland change. The formalized procedure potentially promotes the development of spatial mapping technology for grassland resources.","2151-1535","","10.1109/JSTARS.2021.3110896","Major Science and Technology Project; Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region(grant numbers:2021SZD0036); Key Research and Development Program of Shaanxi(grant numbers:2021NY-170); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:42071316,41631179,61806022,12001057); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(grant numbers:300102120201,300102269205,300102320202,300102269103); National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2017YFB0503600); State Key Laboratory of Geo-Information Engineering(grant numbers:SKLGIE2018-M-3-4); Key Laboratory of Spatial Data Mining and Information Sharing of Ministry of Education; Fuzhou University(grant numbers:2018LSDMIS03); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9531475","Fractional vegetation cover (FVC);geoparcel;grassland;remote sensing;spatial prediction;vegetation index (VI)","Vegetation mapping;Remote sensing;Spatial resolution;Biological system modeling;Shape;Satellites;Indexes","geophysical image processing;land cover;random forests;regression analysis;vegetation;vegetation mapping","geoparcel-based spatial prediction method;grassland fractional vegetation cover;grass resource management;grassland resource information;high spatial resolution remote sensing images;grassland geoparcels;spatial mapping technology;Inner Mongolia;China;Abag Banner;random forest regression","","4","","66","CCBY","8 Sep 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Therefore, we introduce KDDLog, a scalable framework which leverages recursive queries with aggregates and our newly-proposed chain aggregates to enable users to build or customize knowledge discovery models with concise and expressive queries. We further propose specialized compilation techniques for semi-naive fix-point computation in the presence of aggregates, and optimizations for complex recursive queries on distributed data platforms.

Our proposed model generates code summaries in an abstractive manner, taking into account both the structural and sequential information of the input code, while also utilizing an extractive approach that leverages a retrieved summary of similar code to increase the frequency of important keywords. To effectively blend the original code and the retrieved similar code at the embedding layer stage, we obtain the augmented representation of the original code and the retrieved code through multi-head self-attention. In addition, we develop a self-attention network that adaptively learns the structural and sequential information for the representations in the encoder stage. Furthermore, we design a fusion network to capture the relation between the original code and the retrieved summary at the decoder stage. The fusion network effectively guides summary generation based on the retrieved summary. Finally, READSUM extracts important keywords using an extractive approach and generates high-quality summaries using an abstractive approach that considers both the structural and sequential information of the source code.

Inspired by the great success of the pre-training and fine-tuning paradigm in both vision and language tasks, we argue that pre-training is one potential solution for obtaining a scalable model to 3D point cloud downstream tasks as well. In this paper, we, therefore, explore a new self-supervised learning method, called Mixing and Disentangling (MD), for 3D point cloud representation learning. As the name implies, we mix two input shapes and demand the model learning to separate the inputs from the mixed shape. We leverage this reconstruction task as the pretext optimization objective for self-supervised learning. There are two primary advantages: 1) Compared to prevailing image datasets, e.g., ImageNet, point cloud datasets are de facto small. The mixing process can provide a much larger online training sample pool. 2) On the other hand, the disentangling process motivates the model to mine the geometric prior knowledge, e.g., key points. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed pretext task, we build one baseline network, which is composed of one encoder and one decoder. During pre-training, we mix two original shapes and obtain the geometry-aware embedding from the encoder, then an instance-adaptive decoder is applied to recover the original shapes from the embedding. Albeit simple, the pre-trained encoder can capture the key points of an unseen point cloud and surpasses the encoder trained from scratch on downstream tasks. The proposed method has improved the empirical performance on both ModelNet-40 and ShapeNet-Part datasets in terms of point cloud classification and segmentation tasks. We further conduct ablation studies to explore the effect of each component and verify the generalization of our proposed strategy by harnessing different backbones.","1941-0077","","10.1109/TMM.2022.3206664","National Key R&D Program of China(grant numbers:2020AAA0108800); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(grant numbers:226-2022-00087); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9891826","Point cloud Pre-training;Self-supervised learning;Graph Neural Network;Representation learning","Point cloud compression;Task analysis;Training;Three-dimensional displays;Decoding;Shape;Solid modeling","","","","1","","","IEEE","14 Sep 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

Previous RE methods consider only the textual contents and suffer performance decline in social media when texts lack contexts. Incorporating text-related visual information can supplement the missing semantics for relation extraction in social media posts. However, textual relations are usually abstract and of high-level semantics, which causes the semantic gap between visual contents and textual expressions. In this paper, we propose RECK - a neural network for relation extraction with cross-modal knowledge representations. Different from previous multimodal methods training a common subspace for all modalities, we bridge the semantic gaps by explicitly selecting knowledge paths from external knowledge through the cross-modal object-entity pairs.

Researchers have investigated a variety of approaches in order to find a solution to this significant challenge posed by wireless sensor networks. One of these approaches, a routing strategy that is founded on clustering, has been shown to be useful in research studies and is currently regarded as one of the finest solutions to resolve the challenge of excessive energy expenditure. The intention of this study was to find a way to reduce the amount of energy that was used while maintaining acceptable levels of performance. At the beginning, the algorithm will separate the network into individual cells or clusters. The genetic algorithm was then brought into the picture, and it was utilised to determine the optimal number of nodes that should be present in a network. Following the placement of the nodes in the surroundings, the chromosomal length is adjusted to be equal to the quantity of nodes in order to facilitate the process of gradual convergence. As a consequence of this, the length of the chromosomes is reduced, and we are able to reach convergence on the optimal solution more quickly. The cluster heads found inside each chromosome, on the other extreme, are passed to the K-Means method as starting points in order to facilitate a rapid clustering process.","","979-8-3503-3583-5","10.1109/ICISCoIS56541.2023.10100580","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10100580","Clustering;Routing;Wireless sensor networks;Energy efficiency;Network lifetime","Wireless sensor networks;Schedules;Scalability;Throughput;Routing;Security;Task analysis","energy conservation;genetic algorithms;pattern clustering;telecommunication network performance;telecommunication network routing;telecommunication power management;wireless sensor networks","energy efficiency;genetic algorithm;K-Means method;modified cluster based routing;Network lifetime;wireless sensor networks","","","","20","IEEE","19 Apr 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Most of the existing algorithms perform multiview clustering by mining the commonly hidden space between views. Although this strategy is effective, there are two challenges that still need to be addressed to further improve the performance. First, how to design an efficient hidden space learning method so that the learned hidden spaces contain both shared and specific information of multiview data. Second, how to design an efficient mechanism to make the learned hidden space more suitable for the clustering task. In this study, a novel one-step multiview fuzzy clustering (OMFC-CS) method is proposed to address the two challenges by collaborative learning between the common and specific space information. To tackle the first challenge, we propose a mechanism to extract the common and specific information simultaneously based on matrix factorization. For the second challenge, we design a one-step learning framework to integrate the learning of common and specific spaces and the learning of fuzzy partitions. The integration is achieved in the framework by performing the two learning processes alternately and thereby yielding mutual benefit. Furthermore, the Shannon entropy strategy is introduced to obtain the optimal views weight assignment during clustering. The experimental results based on benchmark multiview datasets demonstrate that the proposed OMFC-CS outperforms many existing methods.","2162-2388","","10.1109/TNNLS.2023.3274289","National Key Research & Development Plan(grant numbers:2022YFE0112400); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62176105); Six Talent Peaks Project in Jiangsu Province(grant numbers:XYDXX-056); Hong Kong Research Grants Council(grant numbers:PolyU,152006/19E); Innovation and Technology Commission - Hong Kong(grant numbers:MRP/015/18); Chinese Association for Artificial Intelligence (CAAI)-Huawei MindSpore Open Fund(grant numbers:CAAIXSJLJJ-2021-011A); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10130439","Common space;fuzzy clustering;multiview data;one-step clustering;specific space","Clustering methods;Learning systems;Clustering algorithms;Data mining;Collaboration;Feature extraction;Partitioning algorithms","","","","","","","IEEE","22 May 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

One of the major debatable topics is the duration of that stimulation. To comment on this issue, two different stimulation durations in sensorimotor and visual cortices of the brain are investigated in this study. In order to acquire brain signals for three different tasks performed (right hand index finger poking, right hand index finger tapping, and checkboard) functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) was used. This study tried to investigate the classification accuracy that can be achieved using small stimulation durations i.e., 1 sec and 3 sec. The influence of these two stimulation durations on the hemodynamic response (HR) signal was monitored using fNIRS. In total six participants took part in this study. Simultaneous monitoring of sensorimotor and visual cortices of all the subjects were done during the experiments. The acquired data was first preprocessed and filtered using band-pass filter. The filtered data was then used to extract different features. Different temporal characteristics and numerous time frames were used to extract temporal information after stimulation. The extracted features were used to classify the three different tasks for both of the stimulation durations. The results of the study suggested that brain command for fNIRS-based BCI can be generated within 1~3 sec with accuracies much high above the chance level. These results provide the evidence that long stimulation durations can be avoided and command for BCI can be generated using 1~3 sec stimulation durations.","2770-8373","978-89-93215-23-6","10.23919/ASCC56756.2022.9828043","Korea Institute of Energy Technology Evaluation and Planning; National Research Foundation; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9828043","fNIRS;Brain-computer interface (BCI);short stimulation;classification","Band-pass filters;Visualization;Brain;Fingers;Feature extraction;Information filters;Data mining","band-pass filters;brain;brain-computer interfaces;feature extraction;haemodynamics;infrared spectra;medical signal processing;neurophysiology;signal classification","fNIRS-based BCI;brain activity;brain-computer interface;sensorimotor;visual cortices;brain signals;functional near-infrared spectroscopy;hemodynamic response signal;temporal characteristics;brain command;right hand index finger tapping;band-pass filter;feature extraction","","","","61","","20 Jul 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The dynamic features applications have various characteristics: a) features are processed sequentially while the number of instances is fixed; and b) the feature space does not exist in advance. For example, in a text classification task for spam detection, new features (e.g. words) are dynamically generated and therefore need to be mined to filter out the spams rather than waiting for all features to be collected in order to do so. Traditional feature selection methods, which are not designed for streaming features applications, cannot be used in such an environment, as they require the full feature space in advance in order to statistically determine the representative features. Existing methods that address feature selection in dynamic features applications require the class labels in order to select the representative features. However, most of the real-life data is unlabeled and it is costly to apply manual labeling. In this paper, an efficient unsupervised features selection method is proposed for streaming features applications where the number of features increases while the number of instances remains fixed. In particular, unsupervised Feature Selection for Dynamic Features (UFSSF) is developed to determine the representative streaming features without requiring prior knowledge about data class labels or representative features. The UFSSF extends the k-mean clustering to cumulatively determine whether the newly-arrived feature can be selected as a representative streaming feature, or discarded. Experimental results show significant accuracy results and efficient execution time compared to those of other benchmark methods.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3082755","Australian Department of Industry, Innovation and Science for supporting this work under the Australia-China Science and Research Fund grant on the topic of “Resource Allocation for High-Volume Streaming Data in Data Centres”; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9438634","Feature selection;streaming features;unsupervised learning","Feature extraction;Heuristic algorithms;Computer science;Social networking (online);Real-time systems;Blogs;Machine learning algorithms","data mining;feature extraction;feature selection;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;pattern clustering;statistical analysis;text analysis;unsolicited e-mail;unsupervised learning","unsupervised Feature Selection method;effective Dynamic Features;dynamic features applications;feature space;traditional feature selection methods;representative features;efficient unsupervised features selection method;representative streaming feature;particular Feature Selection;features increases","","7","","29","CCBY","21 May 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Therefore, new methods that can clearly distinguish emotional states in EEG data are required. In this paper, we propose a new emotion recognition method, named AsEmo. The proposed method extracts effective features boosting classification performance on various emotional states from multi-class EEG data. AsEmo Automatically determines the number of spatial filters needed to extract significant features using the explained variance ratio (EVR) and employs a Subject-independent method for real-time processing of Emotion EEG data. The advantages of this method are as follows: (a) it automatically determines the spatial filter coefficients distinguishing emotional states and extracts the best features; (b) it is very robust for real-time analysis of new data using a subject-independent technique that considers subject sets, and not a specific subject; (c) it can be easily applied to both binary-class and multi-class data.

This paper focuses on a cosmetics manufacturer whose 90% of revenue comes from facial skincare. With the new government regulation and the company's background on agility and flexibility in meeting market demands, the company is taking the opportunity to meet the demand for alcohol cosmetics products. Recently, it launched two standard formulations of alcohol sanitizers for private labeling. The objectives of this study are to identify the business processes and related activities in the sanitizer supply chain; to analyze problems, and to provide recommendations for improvement to be able to cope with supply chain disruption and demand spike. An in-depth interview of the owner and staff was conducted, and the sanitizer supply chain was analyzed using Integration Definition for Function Modeling (IDEF0). The results showed major problems from suppliers and brand owners. For suppliers, the lead time is very long, a 100% payment is required, and miscommunications happened. On the other hand, brand owners have very urgent orders due to unanticipated demand from the market. Solutions are suggested in this paper to address the issues on the cosmetic manufacturer's sanitizer supply chain and could serve as a guide for other cosmetics manufacturers.","","978-1-6654-2895-8","10.1109/ICIEA52957.2021.9436740","Kasetsart University; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9436740","agility;integration definition for function modeling;supply chain;alcohol sanitizer;COVID-19","COVID-19;Pandemics;Supply chains;Production;Regulation;Planning;Public healthcare","cosmetics;government;labelling (packaging);organic compounds;pharmaceutical industry;supply and demand;supply chain management;supply chains","supply chain agility;COVID-19;alcohol sanitizer;alcohol gel;alcohol liquid spray;cosmetic manufacturers;ethyl alcohol;cosmetics manufacturer;alcohol cosmetics products;supply chain disruption;Thailand;Ministry of Public Health;facial skincare;government regulation;market demands;private labeling;demand spike;integration definition for function modeling;IDEF0;brand owners;suppliers","","","","13","IEEE","26 May 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The importance of these processes increases with the level and segment at which these systems operate: space, finance, and healthcare sectors are a few examples of systems where faults should be avoided at all costs and actions should be taken to deem the systems usable in case of software failures. Ground segment systems for satellite and mission operations of the space sector belong to this category, where the potential failures must be avoided as early as possible and specific action taken to redeem or prevent them. Anomaly prediction is an engaging concept that can help the maintenance and control of such systems by predicting when they enter fault state. However, it poses a challenging task as the complexity of the systems increases and multiple components or sub-systems are involved in the chain. The ground systems are representative of these complex systems and its operatives can benefit from the prediction and notification of impending anomalies or failures. This can lead to successful plan of actions to be undertaken to avoid problems before they occur and to reduce the maintainability costs if the alert of anomalies and problems could be automated. Within the ground segment space systems only root-cause analysis was employed, where failures of systems were analysed to determine the cause of the errors. The innovation of this approach is to predict ground system failures by learning a model of the system behaviour.","1882-5621","978-1-6654-7318-7","10.1109/WPMC55625.2022.10014733","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10014733","Data mining;anomaly detection;anomaly prediction;unsupervised learning;supervised learning;selforganizing map;long short-term memory","Wireless communication;Technological innovation;Costs;Satellites;Space missions;Maintenance engineering;Predictive models","aerospace computing;artificial satellites;failure analysis;fault diagnosis;ground support systems;learning (artificial intelligence);program debugging;software maintenance;system monitoring;system recovery","anomaly prediction;complex systems;debugging process;fault state;ground segment space systems;ground system failure prediction;log analysis;maintainability cost reduction;maintenance process;mission operations;modern software systems;root-cause analysis;satellite operation;software failures;space sector;system behaviour model learning;system complexity","","","","10","IEEE","20 Jan 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In many of such cases, public authorities have defined sets of principles (e.g., ALCOA+) regarding data management that industrial organizations must abide to, and either deliberate or not violation of these standards most often comes with severe legal consequences. As a matter of fact, in an effort to follow as much as humanly possible to such principles, pharmaceuticals industries invest heavily in resources to maintain high quality standards in their data urging for automated methods for calculating, monitoring and predicting compliance.Also, in complex manufacturing and production lines, data analytics provide means for real-time and continuous monitoring of large numbers of sensor variables and categorical or numerical values where higher order conclusions can be derived and taken into account when business process optimizations are considered.

Our algorithm leverages reinforcement learning and neural network to learn a deployment strategy without any human instruction. Therefore, the service provider can make full use of limited resources to improve the Quality of Service (QoS). Finally, we implement MB_DDPG based on real-world data sets and some synthetic data, and we also implement another two algorithms, genetic algorithm and random algorithm, as a contrast.

In this article, to solve this problem, we propose a novel regularized road surface extraction framework by introducing a graph neural network (GNN) for processing the road graph that is preconstructed from the easily accessible road centerlines. The proposed framework formulates the road surface extraction problem as two-sided width inference of the road graph and consists of a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based feature extractor and a GNN model for vertex attribute adjustment. The CNN extracts the high-level abstract features of each vertex in the graph as the input of the GNN and also the road boundary features that allow us to distinguish roads from the background. The GNN propagates and aggregates the features of the vertices in the graph to achieve global optimization of the regression of the regularized widths of the vertices. At the same time, a biased centerline map can also be corrected based on the width prediction result. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this is the first study to have introduced a GNN to regularized human-level road surface extraction. The proposed method was evaluated on four diverse datasets, and the results show that the proposed method comprehensively outperforms the recent CNN-based segmentation methods and other regularization methods in the intersection over union (IoU) and smoothness score, and a visual check shows that a majority of the prediction results of the proposed method approach the human delineation level.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2022.3151688","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:42171430); State Key Program of the National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:42030102); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9714410","Convolutional neural network (CNN);graph neural network (GNN);regularization;road extraction","Roads;Feature extraction;Remote sensing;Data mining;Task analysis;Convolutional neural networks;Satellites","feature extraction;graph theory;image classification;image segmentation;neural nets;remote sensing;roads","smooth road surface maps;human delineation level;regularized road surface extraction framework;graph neural network;road graph;easily accessible road centerlines;road surface extraction problem;two-sided width inference;convolutional neural network-based feature extractor;GNN model;high-level abstract features;road boundary features;roads;aggregates;regularized widths;biased centerline map;human-level road surface extraction;recent CNN-based segmentation methods;regularization methods;high-resolution remote sensing images;regularized road surface maps","","2","","38","CCBY","15 Feb 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Nonetheless, the desired invariant representation is achieved by utilizing prior online transformation functions on the input data. As a result, each SSL framework is customized for a particular data type, for example, visual data, and further modifications are required if it is used for other dataset types. On the other hand, autoencoder (AE), which is a generic and widely applicable framework, mainly focuses on dimension reduction and is not suited for learning invariant representation. This article proposes a generic SSL framework based on a constrained self-labeling assignment process that prevents degenerate solutions. Specifically, the prior transformation functions are replaced with a self-transformation mechanism, derived through an unsupervised training process of adversarial training, for imposing invariant representations. Via the self-transformation mechanism, pairs of augmented instances can be generated from the same input data. Finally, a training objective based on contrastive learning is designed by leveraging both the self-labeling assignment and the self-transformation mechanism. Despite the fact that the self-transformation process is very generic, the proposed training strategy outperforms a majority of state-of-the-art representation learning methods based on AE structures. To validate the performance of our method, we conduct experiments on four types of data, namely visual, audio, text, and mass spectrometry data and compare them in terms of four quantitative metrics. Our comparison results demonstrate that the proposed method is effective and robust in identifying patterns within the tested datasets.","2162-2388","","10.1109/TNNLS.2023.3265607","Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) Industrial Cooperative Awards in Science & Technology (CASE)(grant numbers:17000013); Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy through the National Measurement System(grant numbers:122416); Alexander von Humboldt Professorship for Artificial Intelligence (AI) endowed by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10113756","Deep neural models;feature extraction;regularized optimal transport;self-supervised learning (SSL);virtual adversarial training (VAT)","Training;Visualization;Perturbation methods;Computational modeling;Task analysis;Feature extraction;Data models","","","","","","","IEEE","1 May 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

Existing unsupervised deep learning-based methods have made great efforts to exploit robust feature representations, but they consume much time to optimize parameters. Besides, these methods use clustering to obtain pseudolabels for training, and the pseudolabeled samples often involve errors, which can be considered as “label noise.” To address these issues, we propose a dual path denoising network (DPDNet) for SAR image change detection. In particular, we introduce the random label propagation to clean the label noise involved in preclassification. We also propose the distinctive patch convolution for feature representation learning to reduce the time consumption. Specifically, the attention mechanism is used to select distinctive pixels in the feature maps, and patches around these pixels are selected as convolution kernels. Consequently, the DPDNet does not require a great number of training samples for parameter optimization, and its computational efficiency is greatly enhanced. Extensive experiments have been conducted on five SAR datasets to verify the proposed DPDNet.

It has been reported that light detection and ranging (LiDAR) data can contribute complementary information to hyperspectral images (HSIs). In this article, a multiple feature-based superpixel-level decision fusion (MFSuDF) method is proposed for HSIs and LiDAR data classification. Specifically, superpixel-guided kernel principal component analysis (KPCA) is first designed and applied to HSIs to both reduce the dimensions and compress the noise impact. Next, 2-D and 3-D Gabor filters are, respectively, employed on the KPCA-reduced HSIs and LiDAR data to obtain discriminative Gabor features, and the magnitude and phase information are both taken into account. Three different modules, including the raw data-based feature cube (concatenated KPCA-reduced HSIs and LiDAR data), the Gabor magnitude feature cube, and the Gabor phase feature cube (concatenation of the corresponding Gabor features extracted from the KPCA-reduced HSIs and LiDAR data), can be, thus, achieved. After that, random forest (RF) classifier and quadrant bit coding (QBC) are introduced to separately accomplish the classification task on the aforementioned three extracted feature cubes. Alternatively, two superpixel maps are generated by utilizing the multichannel simple noniterative clustering (SNIC) and entropy rate superpixel segmentation (ERS) algorithms on the combined HSIs and LiDAR data, which are then used to regularize the three classification maps. Finally, a weighted majority voting-based decision fusion strategy is incorporated to effectively enhance the joint use of the multisource data. The proposed approach is, thus, named MFSuDF. A series of experiments are conducted on three real-world data sets to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed MFSuDF approach. The experimental results show that our MFSuDF can achieve the overall accuracy of 73.64%, 93.88%, and 74.11% for Houston, Trento, and Missouri University and University of Florida (MUUFL) Gulport data sets, respectively, when there are only three samples per class for training.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2020.2996599","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:41971300,61671307,61901278); Program for Young Changjiang Scholars; Research and Development Plan in Key Areas of Guangdong Province(grant numbers:2019B010151001); Shenzhen Scientific Research and Development Funding Program(grant numbers:JCYJ20180305124802421,JCYJ20180305125902403); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9109714","Feature extraction;feature fusion;hyperspectral image (HSI);light detection and ranging (LiDAR);superpixel segmentation","Laser radar;Feature extraction;Hyperspectral imaging;Sensors;Data mining","entropy;face recognition;feature extraction;Gabor filters;geophysical image processing;image classification;image segmentation;optical radar;principal component analysis;radar imaging;remote sensing by radar","Gabor phase feature cube;corresponding Gabor features;aforementioned three extracted feature cubes;combined HSIs;weighted majority voting-based decision fusion strategy;multisource data;real-world data sets;Florida Gulport data sets;multiple feature-based superpixel-level decision fusion;LiDAR data classification;multisource feature extraction;fusion techniques;classification accuracy;light detection;superpixel-guided kernel principal component analysis;3-D Gabor filters;discriminative Gabor features;raw data-based feature cube;concatenated KPCA-reduced HSIs;Gabor magnitude feature cube","","27","","71","IEEE","5 Jun 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In temporal modeling, we propose an Attentive Temporal Convolutional Network (A-TCN) and with spatial configurations as input, it builds group dynamics and is robust to redundant content by considering sequence dependencies. Due to adaptive interaction and attentive dynamics modeling, our approach is able to comprehensively describe team cooperation over time in a tactic. We extensively evaluate the proposed approach on the Volleyball dataset and a newly collected VolleyTactic dataset, and the experimental results show its advantage.","1558-2205","","10.1109/TCSVT.2022.3156634","National Key Research and Development Plan of China(grant numbers:2018AAA0102301); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62022011); Research Program of State Key Laboratory of Software Development Environment(grant numbers:SKLSDE-2021ZX-04); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9727174","Sports video analysis;tactic recognition;group activity recognition;deep learning","Videos;Trajectory;Sports;Games;Feature extraction;Adaptation models;Data mining","computer games;feature extraction;filtering theory;graph theory;image representation;learning (artificial intelligence);spatiotemporal phenomena;sport;video signal processing","spatio-Temporal player relation modeling;tactic recognition;sports videos;novel spatio-temporal relation modeling approach;detailed player interactions;long-range group dynamics;spatial modeling;Adaptive Graph Convolutional Network;local graphs;global graphs;diverse player interactions;temporal modeling;Attentive Temporal Convolutional Network;spatial configurations;attentive dynamics","","2","","76","IEEE","3 Mar 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Accurate estimation of the sound velocity distribution is the key basis for bone ultrasonic imaging. The sound velocity model is usually estimated using travel-time inversion based on the extraction of the time-of-flight (TOF). However, TOF extraction is an intractable task for bone imaging, since the first arrival signal is usually of a small amplitude and submerged in noise. To improve the accuracy of TOF extraction and further guarantee the accuracy of velocity inversion, a segmentation method using convolutional neural network was proposed in this work. The TOF extraction was translated into a binary segmentation problem and solved by the data-driven method. After sound velocity inversion, a velocity-corrected version of the Kirchhoff migration method (MKMM) was developed to reconstruct bone image. The performance of the proposed method was verified by numerical bone models and ex-vivo bovine femurs coated with soft-tissue phantoms. The results demonstrated that the proposed method provided more accurate TOF extractions (i.e., the errors < 0.24 μs for numerical models and < 0.4 μs for ex-vivo specimens). The resulting velocity inversion was significantly improved (the mean relative errors < 4.5% for numerical models and < 5.1% for ex-vivo samples). Moreover, the satisfactory reconstructions of bone and the overlying soft tissue can be observed. It is demonstrated that the proposed method is effective for bone ultrasonic imaging.","2333-9403","","10.1109/TCI.2022.3225670","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:11827808,11874289,12034005,12274094); Program of Shanghai Academic Research Leader(grant numbers:19XD1400500); China Postdoctoral Science Foundation(grant numbers:2019M661334,2022M720814); Shanghai Science and Technology Innovation Plan(grant numbers:20S31901300); Shanghai Rising-Star Program(grant numbers:21QC1400100); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9976242","Bone ultrasound imaging;deep learning;ultrasound computed tomography;U-Net;velocity inversion","Bones;Ultrasonic imaging;Imaging;Acoustics;Image segmentation;Deep learning;Data mining","acoustic tomography;biomechanics;biomedical ultrasonics;bone;convolutional neural nets;deep learning (artificial intelligence);image reconstruction;image segmentation;medical image processing;ultrasonic imaging","acoustic impedance contrast;bone image;bone ultrasonic imaging;bone ultrasound tomography;image bone;numerical bone models;numerical models;soft tissue;sound velocity distribution;sound velocity inversion;sound velocity model;TOF extraction;travel-time inversion;ultrasound imaging modalities;velocity inversion;velocity-corrected version","","","","69","IEEE","8 Dec 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

With the increasing number of mobile devices, achieving efficient service migration management has become non-trivial in MEC. In addition, the service migration issue is difficult to be solved in real-time due to user mobility and dynamic network conditions. In this paper, we investigate the mobility-aware service migration problem in MEC by introducing a data-driven framework. Firstly, service migration is formulated as an optimization problem for minimizing the long-term system delay that consists of computing, communication, and migration delays. Secondly, we propose a Mobility-aware Service Migration scheme, named MSM, consisting of three layers: 1) the data collection layer; 2) the association patterns analysis layer; and 3) the service migration layer. Specifically, we first collect users’ historical Wi-Fi traces to mine the association patterns. We then design a user management mechanism to reduce the complexity of decision-making by using user association patterns. Finally, we formulate the service migration as a 2D-Markov decision process and devise a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) based algorithm to obtain service migration decisions in a large-scale MEC scenario. Extensive data-driven experiments are conducted to demonstrate the efficacy of MSM in reducing the system delay.","2327-4662","","10.1109/JIOT.2023.3265434","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62102223, 62002389); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10097492","Mobile edge computing;service migration;user mobility;reinforcement learning;data-driven","Delays;Task analysis;Servers;Wireless fidelity;Reinforcement learning;Optimization;Heuristic algorithms","","","","","","","IEEE","7 Apr 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

AT has been indicated as an advanced regularizer due to its adversarial mechanism, ability to mine hard samples, and nature of data augmentation. However, serving as an augmentation-based regularizer, AT shows low diversity of the perturbation, excessive computational cost, and the optimization dilemma between adversarial robustness and accuracy for ReID task, and is thus suboptimal. To tackle these limitations and get a more effective regularizer for ReID, we rethink the nature of AT and unveil that the adversarial data augmentation is essentially reflected by gradients. Based on this, a novel implicit regularizer, named Stochastic Gradient Perturbation (SGP), is proposed, which naturally brings three merits: 1) Better diversity of the perturbation due to the proposed non-directional stochastic perturbations rather than directional adversarial perturbations. 2) Lower computational cost due to the proposed implicit gradient augmentation rather than explicitly additional data. 3) The optimization dilemma of the adversarial robustness and generalization is naturally overcome since SGP contains the adversarial gradient perturbation. Further, we put forward a perspective that the generalization and adversarial robustness may have an inter unity. Experiments on the baseline and SOTA models demonstrate powerful performances of the plugged-played SGP, and both generalization and adversarial robustness can be guaranteed.","1558-2205","","10.1109/TCSVT.2023.3261333","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10081020","Regularization;Person ReID;Generalization;Adversarial Robustness","Robustness;Perturbation methods;Stochastic processes;Data models;Training;Optimization;Semantics","","","","","","","IEEE","24 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

To address this drawback, we propose self-supervised discriminative feature learning for deep multi-view clustering (SDMVC). Concretely, deep autoencoders are applied to learn embedded features for each view independently. To leverage the multi-view complementary information, we concatenate all views’ embedded features to form the global features, which can overcome the negative impact of some views’ unclear clustering structures. In a self-supervised manner, pseudo-labels are obtained to build a unified target distribution to perform multi-view discriminative feature learning. During this process, global discriminative information can be mined to supervise all views to learn more discriminative features, which in turn are used to update the target distribution. Besides, this unified target distribution can make SDMVC learn consistent cluster assignments, which accomplishes the clustering consistency of multiple views while preserving their features’ diversity. Experiments on various types of multi-view datasets show that SDMVC outperforms 14 competitors including classic and state-of-the-art methods.

For the main modality or each of the modalities, it is important to enhance the visual information by modeling the connection and effectively fusing the features among them. However, the existing methods for multimodal segmentation have a drawback; they coincidentally drop information of individual modality during the fusion process. Recently, graph learning-based methods have been applied in segmentation, and these methods have achieved considerable improvements by modeling the relationships across feature regions and reasoning using global information. In this paper, we propose a graph learning-based approach to efficiently extract modality-specific features and establish regional correspondence effectively among all modalities. In detail, after projecting features into a graph domain and employing graph convolution to propagate information across all regions for learning global modality-specific features, we propose a mutual information-based graph co-attention module to learn the weight coefficients of one bipartite graph constructed by the fully connected graphs having different modalities in the graph domain and by selectively fusing the node features. Based on the deformation diagram between the spatial-graph space and our proposed graph co-attention module, we present a multimodal prior-guided segmentation framework, which uses two strategies for two clinical situations: Modality-Specific Learning Strategy and Co-Modality Learning Strategy. Besides, the improved Co-Modality Learning Strategy is used with trainable weights in the multi-task loss for the optimization of the proposed framework. We validated our proposed modules and frameworks on two multimodal MRI datasets: our private liver lesion dataset and a public prostate zone dataset.

This problem is important to city planners to evaluate and develop urban deployment plans. However, this task is challenging. Traditional traffic estimation approaches lack the ability to solve this problem, since no data about the impact can be collected before the deployment and old data fails to capture the traffic pattern changes. In this paper, we define the off-deployment traffic estimation problem as a traffic generation problem, and develop a novel deep generative model TrafficGAN that captures the shared patterns across spatial regions of how traffic conditions evolve according to travel demand changes and underlying road network structures. In particular, TrafficGAN captures the road network structures through a dynamic filter in the dynamic convolutional layer. We evaluate our TrafficGAN using a large-scale traffic data collected from Shenzhen, China. Results show that TrafficGAN can more accurately estimate the traffic conditions compared with all baselines.

To mitigate this problem and to improve classification for longer texts, researchers have sought to resolve the underlying causes of the computational cost and have proposed optimizations for the attention mechanism, which is the key element of every transformer model. In our study, we are not pursuing the ultimate goal of long text classification, i.e., the ability to analyze entire text instances at one time while preserving high performance at a reasonable computational cost. Instead, we propose a text truncation method called Text Guide, in which the original text length is reduced to a predefined limit in a manner that improves performance over naive and semi-naive approaches while preserving low computational costs. Text Guide benefits from the concept of feature importance, a notion from the explainable artificial intelligence domain. We demonstrate that Text Guide can be used to improve the performance of recent language models specifically designed for long text classification, such as Longformer.

Besides, these approaches mainly focus on the foreground-background target class segmentation setting. They only utilize binary mask labels for training. In this paper, we propose to leverage the multi-class label information during the episodic training. It will encourage the network to generate more semantically meaningful features for each category.

However, homogeneous deep learning models are pervasively adopted without considering the difference between distinct data in various clients, resulting in low learning performance and high communication costs. This paper thus proposes a novel FL framework with heterogeneous structured client models for handling different data scales and investigates its superiority over canonical FL with homogeneous models. Additionally, singular value decomposition is adopted on the client models to reduce the amount of transmitted data, i.e., the communication costs.

Efficient QoS-aware service composition has been a challenging task in cloud computing. This challenge becomes more formidable in emerging resource-constrained computing paradigms, such as the Internet of Things and Fog. Service composition has regarded as a multi-objective combinatorial optimization problem that falls in the category of NP-hard. Historically, the proliferation of services added to problem complexity and navigated solutions from exact (none-heuristics) approaches to near-optimal heuristics and metaheuristics. Although metaheuristics have fulfilled some expectations, the quest for finding a high-quality, near-optimal solution has led researchers to devise hybrid methods. As a result, research on service composition shifts towards the hybridization of metaheuristics. Hybrid metaheuristics have been promising efforts to transcend the boundaries of metaheuristics by leveraging the strength of complementary methods to overcome base algorithm shortcomings. Despite the significance and frontier position of hybrid metaheuristics, to the best of our knowledge, there is no systematic research and survey in this field with a particular focus on strategies to hybridize traditional metaheuristics. This study’s core contribution is to infer a framework for hybridization strategies by conducting a mapping study that analyses 71 papers between 2008 and 2020. Moreover, it provides a panoramic view of hybrid methods and their experiment setting in respect to the problem domain as the main outcome of this mapping study.

However, in view of the poor signals collected by wearable devices and the less variation between signals of different classes (normal/SAS), the detection methods in past studies are often unsatisfactory. In this study, a wearable SAS detection method based on 1-D multitask multiattention residual shrinkage convolution neural network (1D-MMResSNet) model and cost-sensitive (CS) classifier was proposed. First, the photoplethysmography (PPG) sleep data of 92 subjects were collected by using wearable smart Bracelet devices. Second, a backbone network composed of the residual multiattention mechanism convolution block and residual shrinkage convolution block was proposed to realize feature selection and feature extraction for pulse rate variability signals. At the same time, the single supervised learning task of the network was improved, and a multitask learning method was proposed to enhance the ability of the network to mine subtle differences between data, thereby effectively learning the discriminative network features. Finally, the AdaCost cost-sensitive algorithm was introduced to alleviate the class imbalance problem in data samples. In segment detection, the accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity were 81.82%, 70.27%, and 85.81%, respectively; In individual detection, the accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity were 95.65%, 88.89%, and 97.30%, respectively.

However, it is still a challenging task to achieve building extraction with high accuracy and integrity due to diverse building appearances and more complex ground background in VHR remote sensing images. Recently, unity networking (UNet) has been proven to be capable of feature extraction and semantic segmentation of remote sensing images. However, UNet cannot achieve sufficient multiscale and multilevel features with larger receptive fields. To address these problems, an improved network based on UNet structure (Refine-UNet) is proposed for extracting buildings from the VHR images. The proposed Refine-UNet mainly consists of an encoder module, a decoder module, and a refine skip connection scheme. The refine skip connection scheme is composed of an atrous spatial convolutional pyramid pooling (ASPP) module and several improved depthwise separable convolution (IDSC) modules. Experimental results on the Jilin-1 VHR datasets with a spatial resolution of 0.75 m demonstrate that compared with UNet, pyramid scene parsing network (PSPNet), DeepLabV3+, and a deep convolutional encoder-decoder architecture for image segmentation (SegNet), the proposed Refine-UNet can obtain more accurate building extraction results and achieve the best precision of 95.1% and intersection over union (IoU) of 87.0%, indicating the great practical potential.","1558-0571","","10.1109/LGRS.2023.3243609","Project of Jilin Province Development and Reform Commission(grant numbers:2021C044-7); Technological Research and Development Projects of Jilin(grant numbers:20220201017GX); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10041175","Atrous convolution;building extraction;unity networking (UNet);very high-resolution (VHR) remote sensing imagery","Buildings;Feature extraction;Convolution;Remote sensing;Decoding;Data mining;Spatial resolution","convolutional neural nets;deep learning (artificial intelligence);feature extraction;geophysical image processing;image classification;image resolution;image segmentation;object detection;remote sensing","accurate building extraction results;atrous spatial convolutional pyramid pooling module;diverse building appearances;extracting buildings;feature extraction;high-resolution remote sensing images;image segmentation;improved depthwise separable convolution modules;Jilin-1 VHR datasets;multilevel features;pyramid scene parsing network;refine skip connection scheme;Refine-UNet;size 0.75 m;sufficient multiscale features;UNet scene parsing network;UNet structure;VHR images;VHR remote sensing images","","","","18","IEEE","9 Feb 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this article, we present Plasticity-on-Chip (PoC) by engineering plasticity into ”artificial brains” to mine and exploit the self-similarity of HLPs. First, we present a communication modeling of HLPs (e.g., C/C++ implementations of various applications) that relies on static and dynamic compiler analysis of programs with varying input seeds, performing comprehensive program analysis of all traces, and representing the HLPs as weighted directed acyclic graphs while capturing the intrinsic timing constraints and data/control flow requirements. Second, we propose a rigorous mathematical framework for determining the optimal parallel degree of executing a set of interacting HLPs (by partitioning them into clusters of densely interconnected supernodes - tasks) which helps us decide the number of available heterogeneous PEs, the amount of required memory and the structure of the synthesized deadlock-free irregular NoC topology that offers an efficient communication medium. These clusters serve as abstract models of computation for the synthesized PEs within the parallel execution model. Finally, exploiting the fractal and complex networks concepts, we extract in-depth features from graphs that serve as inputs for distributed reinforcement learning. Our experimental results on synthesized PEs and NoCs show performance improvements as high as 7.61x when compared to the traditional NoC and 2.6x compared to gem5-Aladdin.","1557-9956","","10.1109/TC.2021.3071507","National Science Foundation(grant numbers:CPS/CNS-1453860); National Science Foundation(grant numbers:CCF-1837131,MCB-1936775,CNS-1932620); Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency(grant numbers:N66001-17-1-4044); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9397284","Software hardware codesign;optimal parallelization degree;self-similarity;graph neural networks;intelligent scheduler","Conferences;Portable document format;Indexes;Typesetting;Loading;Web sites;Warranties","Big Data;complex networks;concurrency control;directed graphs;learning (artificial intelligence);multiprocessing systems;network-on-chip;optimisation;program compilers","input seeds;comprehensive program analysis;weighted directed acyclic graphs;intrinsic timing constraints;optimal parallel degree;heterogeneous PE;efficient communication medium;synthesized PEs;parallel execution model;fractal networks concepts;complex networks concepts;distributed reinforcement learning;Plasticity-on-Chip design;data communications;distributed big data analytics;data-intensive programs;memory banks;mathematical models;brain-inspired plasticity;computing platforms;topological complexity;high-level programs;fractal characteristics;reconfigurable domain-specific;engineering plasticity;artificial brains;communication modeling;densely interconnected supernodes;interacting HLP","","14","","41","IEEE","6 Apr 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, most GAN-based generator-discriminator frameworks randomly generate the negative samples from the original graph distributions to enhance the training process of the discriminator without considering the noise. In addition, most of these methods only focus on the explicit graph structures and cannot fully capture complex semantics of edges such as various relationships or asymmetry. In order to address these issues, we propose a robust and generalized framework named AGE. It generates fake neighbors as the enhanced negative samples from the implicit distribution, and enables the discriminator and generator to jointly learn robust and generalized node representations. Based on this framework, we propose three models to handle three types of graph data and derive the corresponding optimization algorithms, namely the UG-AGE  and DG-AGE  for undirected and directed homogeneous graphs, respectively, and the HIN-AGE for heterogeneous information networks.

An increasing number of solutions in EC have employed machine learning (ML) methods to perform data classification and other information processing tasks on continuous and evolving data streams. Usually, such solutions have to cope with vast amounts of data that come as data streams while balancing energy consumption, latency, and the predictive performance of the algorithms. Ensemble methods achieve remarkable predictive performance when applied to evolving data streams due to several models and the possibility of selective resets. This work investigates a strategy that introduces short intervals to defer the processing of mini-batches. Well balanced, our strategy can improve the performance (i.e., delay, throughput) and reduce the energy consumption of bagging ensembles to classify data streams.

Voting classifier uses the knowledge of all the candidate classifiers but ignores the performance of the model on different classes. In the proposed model, weight is assigned to each model based on its performance for each class. For the optimal selection of weights for the candidate classifiers, Genetic Algorithm is used and the proposed model is called Genetic Algorithm Voting (GA-V) classifier. After labeling the suggested features by using a fixed threshold, several classifiers like Bayesian logistic regression, Naïve Bayes, BayesNet, Random Forest, SVM, Decision Tree, LSTM and AdaboostM1 are trained on MovieLens dataset to find high-quality/popular movies in different categories. All the traditional ML models are compared with GA-V in terms of precision, recall and F1 score. The results show the significance of the proposed features and proposed GA-V classifier.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3195228","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9845402","Weighted voting classifier;movie recommendation;classification;feature engineering","Motion pictures;Predictive models;Data models;Genetic algorithms;Bayes methods;Social networking (online);Recommender systems","Bayes methods;data mining;decision trees;genetic algorithms;information filtering;information filters;information retrieval;Internet;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;recommender systems;regression analysis;search engines;social networking (online);support vector machines","adaptive Voting classifier;information retrieval;huge social web data;conventional search engines;information filtering recommender systems;movie quality aspects;social web content;social-quality;tag quality;temporal aspect;social quality;temporal features;enhanced optimization-based;candidate classifiers;Genetic Algorithm Voting classifier;suggested features","","1","","83","CCBY","1 Aug 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this paper, our solution enables the ubiquitous but coarse-grained location-based surveillance information to predict the fine-grained trajectories of all vehicles with limited number of fine-grained trajectories. We first capture the vectorized semantic representation of trajectories by training the spatiotemporal embedding in large coarse trajectory set. Then, we propose a new measurement to calculate the trajectory similarity, which combines the vehicles' historical behavior similarity and short-term trajectory similarity. The obtained trajectory similarity is then seamlessly embedded into the dynamic graph convolution network in the manner of spatial attention. The dynamic graph convolution sequence-to-sequence module and the fully-connected layer are devised to generate final sequential trajectory predictions. The whole process is to train in a multi-task framework.

Digital twins are the enablers for the creation of such ecosystems. Digital twins create the transparency in the virtual design, tests, implementation optimization of the products, processes or even entire production systems. The modern IoE (Internet of Everything) technology is able to cover a new dimension in terms of monitoring and controlling an operating state of a product, process or system. Digital twin as a virtual representation of the product, production or performance enables the seamless linkage of the individual process steps in the fiber production. This increases efficiency, minimizes the error rate, shortens development cycles and also opens up new business opportunities – that ensuring a sustainable increase the competitiveness in the fiber industry. Unfortunately, it is a very complex topic and has a high impact on internal and external processes. The technical challenges are spread in different domains. Most of fiber production companies currently use only single elements of the digital twins solution in some sub-areas – the overarching solution is missing. Many technical challenges come with the implementation of the architecture of digital twin. The architecture consists of physical devices, an optional device management system, a connectivity solution, a platform, and the actual application. The physical devices capture the data from the real twin (eg. melting furnace, bushings etc). It transports the information to the platform, or it will be stored temporarily in the device management. The device management has the task to control all devices. This is sometimes necessary when the devices are from different suppliers or the device itself is complex. Building Information Modelling (BIM) plays an important role for the planning, design, constructing, operating and maintaining of the new fiber production facilities. Besides a successful implementation of digital twins for the innovative basalt fiber production 4.0 this presentation provides a pragmatic approach to get access to the digital twin technology in the fiber industry. It covers the range from the conceptual understanding of a digital twin to a successful implementation.","","978-1-6654-1611-5","10.1109/EMCTECH53459.2021.9619180","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9619180","Digital twin (DT);Industry 4.0;Fiber Indstry;Basalt Fiber Production;PLM;Industrial IoT (IIoT)","Industries;Production systems;Digital twin;Ecosystems;Process control;Companies;Optical fiber communication","innovation management;Internet of Things;product design;production engineering computing;production facilities;virtual reality","IoE;Internet of Everything;smart digitalization;basalt fiber production 4.0;digital ecosystems;fiber industry;digital twin technology;fiber production facilities","","","","6","IEEE","3 Dec 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, existing RGB-based scene comprehension methods may achieve unsatisfied performance when dealing with complex scenarios, insufficient illumination or occluded appearances. To solve this problem, by cooperating visual and thermal images, the Dual-Space Graph-based Interaction Network (DSGBINet) is proposed to achieve all-day time semantic segmentation of power equipment in high-voltage power transmission line and electric transformer substation scenes. Specifically, modality-specific features are first extracted via two separate backbone networks with the same architecture. Multi-modality high-level features are first fused via long-range relationship in coordinate space. Then, multi-modality features from regular grids are further clustered and assigned to vertices in feature space. Cross-graph and inner-graph regional relations are utilized for reasoning and enhancement, which could exploit the mutual benefits and extract rich contextual information in a semantic view. Furthermore, to overcome the huge scale difference and the inherent characteristic of thermal images, the idea of multi-task learning is integrated into the decoding process. The edge detection and semantic segmentation are achieved collaboratively, which could segment the different power equipment more accurately and completely. The comparative and ablation experiments on the proposed two RGB-T semantic segmentation datasets evaluate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed network compared with existing state-of-the-art methods.

Due to the lack of labeled data especially in the pixelwise task, it is urgent to develop unsupervised techniques to effectively detect changes. In this article, we propose a novel unsupervised representation learning framework for CD in SAR images, called multiscale self-attention (SA) deep clustering based on octave convolution. The main motivation is that a convolutional neural network (CNN) has the ability to extract significant feature hidden in input images, but it relies heavily on annotated data. Clustering is typically free from supervision; however, SAR images always suffer from speckle noise, which is unfriendly for clustering. Thus, we integrate unsupervised clustering with CNN to learn clustering-friendly feature representations. In the unified framework, CNN feature learning and clustering can be optimized end-to-end without supervision. To better suppress speckle noise and boost the joint optimization for distinguishing changes and unchanges, we use the K-means++ algorithm that is robust to noise as the clustering algorithm. In the meanwhile, we introduce the octave convolution and SA mechanism into the network to fully mine important spatial structure information for enhancing noise resistance of the network. Moreover, multiscale fusion modules are proposed to fuse multiscale input into a complementary feature representation that contains more context and semantic information around each pixel so that it refines the difference feature extraction while reducing speckle noise. Experiments on challenging SAR data sets demonstrate the effectiveness and potential of the proposed model compared with the current state-of-the-art algorithms.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2021.3073562","Key Scientific Technological Innovation Research Project by the Ministry of Education; State Key Program of National Natural Science of China(grant numbers:61836009); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:U1701267,61871310); Fund for Foreign Scholars in University Research and Teaching Programs (the 111 Project)(grant numbers:B07048); Major Research Plan of the National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:91438201); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9420689","Change detection (CD);deep clustering;multiscale fusion;octave convolution;self-attention (SA) mechanism;synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images","Feature extraction;Radar polarimetry;Speckle;Synthetic aperture radar;Convolution;Clustering algorithms;Pipelines","convolutional neural nets;feature extraction;geophysical image processing;image classification;image representation;image segmentation;object detection;pattern clustering;radar imaging;remote sensing by radar;speckle;synthetic aperture radar;unsupervised learning","SAR images;synthetic aperture radar image change detection;unsupervised techniques;unsupervised representation learning framework;octave convolution;convolutional neural network;significant feature;input images;annotated data;unsupervised clustering;clustering-friendly feature representations;CNN feature learning;speckle noise suppression;clustering algorithm;multiscale fusion modules;multiscale input;complementary feature representation;difference feature extraction;SAR data sets;multiscale self-attention deep clustering","","9","","51","IEEE","3 May 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

IoT devices that are limited in their resource capacity are unable to employ the Proof-of-Work (PoW) algorithm that is currently in use since the mining process has a high computational dimensionality.

Joint learning of knowledge in different graphs is an effective means to uncover the intrinsic structure of samples. However, the existing methods fail to simultaneously mine the global and local information related to sample structure and distribution when multiple graphs are available, and further research is needed. Hence, we propose a novel intrinsic graph learning (IGL) with discrete constrained diffusion–fusion to solve the above problem in this article. In detail, given a set of the predefined graphs, IGL first obtains the graph encoding the global high-order manifold structure via the diffusion–fusion mechanism based on the tensor product graph. Then, two discrete operators are integrated to fine-prune the obtained graph. One of them limits the maximum number of neighbors connected to each sample, thereby removing redundant and erroneous edges. The other one forces the rank of the Laplacian matrix of the obtained graph to be equal to the number of sample clusters, which guarantees that samples from the same subgraph belong to the same cluster and vice versa. Moreover, a new strategy of weight learning is designed to accurately quantify the contribution of pairwise predefined graphs in the optimization process.

In this design study, we show how interactive visual exploration and analysis of high-dimensional, spectral data from noise simulation can facilitate design improvements in the context of conflicting criteria. Here, we focus on structure-borne noise, i.e., noise from vibrating mechanical parts. Detecting problematic noise sources early in the design and production process is essential for reducing a product's development costs and its time to market. In a close collaboration of visualization and automotive engineering, we designed a new, interactive approach to quickly identify and analyze critical noise sources, also contributing to an improved understanding of the analyzed system. Several carefully designed, interactive linked views enable the exploration of noises, vibrations, and harshness at multiple levels of detail, both in the frequency and spatial domain. This enables swift and smooth changes of perspective; selections in the frequency domain are immediately reflected in the spatial domain, and vice versa. Noise sources are quickly identified and shown in the context of their neighborhood, both in the frequency and spatial domain. We propose a novel drill-down view, especially tailored to noise data analysis. Split boxplots and synchronized 3D geometry views support comparison tasks. With this solution, engineers iterate over design optimizations much faster, while maintaining a good overview at each iteration.

A cell in a spreadsheet holds one specific value and gives a discrete, overprecise view of the underlying model. Therefore, spreadsheets are of limited use when investigating the inherent uncertainties of such models and answering what-if questions. Existing extensions typically require a complex modeling process that cannot easily be embedded in a tabular layout. In Fuzzy Spreadsheet, a cell can hold and display a distribution of values. This integrated uncertainty-handling immediately conveys sensitivity and robustness information. The fuzzification of the cells enables calculations not only with precise values but also with distributions, and probabilities. We conservatively added and carefully crafted visuals to maintain the look and feel of a traditional spreadsheet while facilitating what-if analyses. Given a user-specified reference cell, Fuzzy Spreadsheet automatically extracts and visualizes contextually relevant information, such as impact, uncertainty, and degree of neighborhood, for the selected and related cells. To evaluate its usability and the perceived mental effort required, we conducted a user study. The results show that our approach outperforms traditional spreadsheets in terms of answer correctness, response time, and perceived mental effort in almost all tasks tested.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2021.3119212","FFG(grant numbers:881844); Austrian COMET Program Competence Centers for Excellent Technologies; Austrian Federal Ministry for Digital and Economic Affairs; Provinces of Upper Austria and Styria; State of Upper Austria and the Austrian Federal Ministry of Education, Science and Research(grant numbers:LIT-2019-7-SEE-117); Federal State of Upper Austria; Bundesministerium für Verkehr, Innovation und Technologie; Bundesministerium für Wissenschaft, Forschung und Wirtschaft; Styria; SFG and Vienna Business Agency(grant numbers:854174); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9566799","Uncertainty visualization;tabular data;spreadsheet augmentation","Uncertainty;Costs;Automobiles;Tools;Visualization;Computational modeling;Maintenance engineering","data visualisation;fuzzy set theory;probability;spreadsheet programs","complex modeling process;fuzzy spreadsheet;integrated uncertainty-handling;spreadsheet-based tools;tabular calculations;tabular layout;user-specified reference cell","","","","58","IEEE","11 Oct 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The reliable detection of single multi-digit values from natural imagery has been widely studied through the last decade (e.g. Street View House Numbers [SVHN]); however, extraction and assignment of the contextual meaning of those values are far more difficult given the diversity and unstructured nature of advertisements. To operationalize information extracted from detected values in the wild, the contextual meaning that those values represent is critical. To our knowledge, no large-scale visual dataset comprising multi-digit, multi-number values with associated context labels exists; we denote this class of problems as “multi-metric extraction in the wild”. In this work, we focus on the accurate detection and reading of gas prices, and their contextual association to gas grade and payment type. We provide complete annotations for the Gas Prices of America (GPA) dataset, comprising 2,048 training and 512 test images sampled across the United States including over 2,600 signs, 6,000 prices, 27,000 digits, and 7,800 gas grade and payment type labels. With these data, we develop the GasBotty predictor, a composite neural network model, and evaluate it over eight benchmark tasks of increasing difficulty. Finally, we define a new highly stringent, binary-type metric, denoted “All-or-Nothing Accuracy” (ANA), requiring that a predictor perfectly extract and correctly associate all information in a gas sign. Our proposed model achieves 72.9% ANA over the independent test set of 512 images, where conventional state-of-the-art models object detection models and both a uniform random and biased random predictor would all tend towards 0% ANA. GasBotty and the GPA dataset will serve as a valuable benchmark for the development of future multi-metric extraction in the wild systems.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3156578","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9727170","Multi-metric extraction;machine vision;optical character recognition","Data mining;Predictive models;Measurement;Annotations;Visualization;Benchmark testing;Transforms","advertising;neural nets;object detection","GasBotty;reliable detection;single multidigit values;natural imagery;street view house numbers;detected values;multinumber values;gas prices;contextual association;highly stringent type metric;binary-type metric;gas sign;wild systems;commodity advertisement;large-scale visual dataset;context labels;gas grade;payment type labels;multimetric extraction;ANA;all-or-nothing accuracy;composite neural network model","","1","","32","CCBY","3 Mar 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

These limitations hamper the meaningful adoption of BDA, especially the time and situation critical edge use cases, and hinder the goals of Industry 4.0 and Society 5.0. Automating the BDA process at the edge is a cognitive approach to address the aforementioned concerns. Data science workflow is an indispensable challenge for successful automation. Therefore, we conducted a systematic literature survey on data science workflow platforms as the first contribution. Moreover, we learned that the BDA workflow depends on diversified constraints and undergoes rigorous data-mining stages. These caused an increase in the solution space, dynamic constraints, complexity issues, and NP-hardness of BDA workflow. Graphplan is a heuristic AI-planning technique that can address concerns associated with BDA workflow.

Thus, they post related questions on external online sources to seek better commenting practices. In this paper, we analyze code comment discussions on online sources such as Stack Overflow (SO) and Quora to shed some light on the questions developers ask about commenting practices. We apply Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to identify emerging topics concerning code comments. Then we manually analyze a statistically significant sample set of posts to derive a taxonomy that provides an overview of the developer questions about commenting practices.Our results highlight that on SO nearly 40% of the questions mention how to write or process comments in documentation tools and environments, and nearly 20% of the questions are about potential limitations and possibilities of documentation tools to add automatically and consistently more information in comments. On the other hand, on Quora, developer questions focus more on background information (35% of the questions) or asking opinions (16% of the questions) about code comments. We found that (i) not all aspects of comments are covered in coding style guidelines, e.g., how to add a specific type of information, (ii) developers need support in learning the syntax and format conventions to add various types of information in comments, and (iii) developers are interested in various automated strategies for comments such as detection of bad comments, or verify comment style automatically, but lack tool support to do that.","2470-6892","978-1-6654-4897-0","10.1109/SCAM52516.2021.00027","National Science Foundation; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9610635","Mining online sources;Stack Overflow;Quora;Code Comment analysis;Software documentation","Codes;Taxonomy;Documentation;Manuals;Tools;Syntactics;Maintenance engineering","question answering (information retrieval);software maintenance;system documentation;text analysis","developers discuss;code comments;code documentation;commenting practices;code comment discussions;questions developers;developer questions;bad comments;verify comment style","","2","","51","IEEE","24 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

So satisfying a customer’s need is really important and hence the need for market segmentation. The general objective of this research service is to analyze various factors which influence the student’s admission process in various private institutions. Various factors like teaching staff, quality of education, and facilities play an important role in influencing students while selecting a college or university. But as Technology is increasing, we can say digital advertisement also plays an important role in luring a student to select a particular college/university through various online platforms such as websites, emails, etc., and just like that several factors need consideration. So the main aim of this research is to analyze all the factors and their broad segments which can be used by various higher education managers to develop strategies and customize their plans for making their businesses more profitable. A student survey allows students to share their issues, needs, and desires, giving feedback on how a teacher can change his or her instruction to help them perform better in class.

From the data sources, we gather even security patches that cannot be collected by considering only CVE information (i. e., previously untracked security patches). In our experiments, we collected 12,432 CVE patches from repositories and issue trackers, and 12,458 insecure posts from Q&A sites. We could collect at least four times more CVE patches than those collected in existing approaches, which demonstrates the efficacy of our approach.

The positive effects brought by the implementation of emission reduction measures by enterprises are sufficient to make up for the costs incurred by enterprises in taking emission reduction measures, thereby enhancing the market value of enterprises. To overcome the adverse effects of the volatility and uncertainty of energy consumption in high-energy-consuming industries on energy consumption, this paper proposes a cloud model load group dynamic regulation algorithm that takes into account delay compensation, and designs a load regulation with LA as the middleman Under the constraints of load adjustable margin, considering the delay in the aggregation process of high energy-consuming industry load groups, the LS-SVM method is used to make ultra-short-term predictions for user load groups in the aggregation delay interval. The real-time fluctuation of the load group uses the two-dimensional cloud task generator to dynamically compensate the control amount to improve the control effect. This solution integrates the load resources of the user group, realizes the consumption of energy consumption fluctuations, and optimizes the resource optimization on the demand side. The configuration has played a significant role in improving the balance of power supply and demand in the regional power grid and has played a role in ensuring the stability of the power grid.","","978-3-8007-6025-1","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10104474","","","","","","","","","","19 Apr 2023","","","VDE","VDE Conferences"

Considering that the evaluation of alternatives is generally affected by several criteria, decision-making should be considered a very challenging task. From the 1945s to the present day, various multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) methods have evolved, supporting people in the decision-making process. The main aim of this paper is to propose an original MCDM method and to demonstrate its applicability in an empirical case study that relates to the Electric Vehicle (EV) selection problem. To solve the electric vehicle selection problem for the last-mile delivery, we developed and applied a new MCDM method - the AROMAN (Alternative Ranking Order Method Accounting for Two-Step Normalization) method. The main contribution of the AROMAN method is coupling the linear and vector normalization techniques to obtain precise data structures used in further calculation. In addition, the original final ranking equation is developed. To demonstrate the robustness of the proposed method, a comparative analysis with other state-of-the-art MCDM methods is conducted. The results indicate a high level of confidence in the AROMAN method in the decision-making field. In addition, the sensitivity analysis is performed, and the results indicate a high level of stability.

A fast and efficient build process is crucial to provide timely CI feedback to developers. If CI feedback is too slow, developers may switch contexts to other tasks, which is known to be a costly operation for knowledge workers. Thus, minimizing the build execution time for CI services is an important task. While recent work has made several important advances in the acceleration of CI builds, optimizations often depend upon explicitly defined build dependency graphs (e.g., make, Gradle, CloudBuild, Bazel). These hand-maintained graphs may be (a) underspecified, leading to incorrect build behaviour; or (b) overspecified, leading to missed acceleration opportunities. In this paper, we propose Kotinos—a language-agnostic approach to infer data from which build acceleration decisions can be made without relying upon build specifications. After inferring this data, our approach accelerates CI builds by caching the build environment and skipping unaffected build steps. Kotinos is at the core of a commercial CI service with a growing customer base. To evaluate Kotinos, we mine 14,364 historical CI build records spanning three proprietary and seven open-source software projects. We find that: (1) at least 87.9 percent of the builds activate at least one Kotinos acceleration; and (2) 74 percent of accelerated builds achieve a speed-up of two-fold with respect to their non-accelerated counterparts. Moreover, (3) the benefits of Kotinos can also be replicated in open source software systems; and (4) Kotinos imposes minimal resource overhead (i.e., $<$< 1 percent median CPU usage, 2 MB – 2.2 GB median memory usage, and 0.4 GB – 5.2 GB median storage overhead) and does not compromise build outcomes. Our results suggest that migration to Kotinos yields substantial benefits with minimal investment of effort (e.g., no migration of build systems is necessary).","1939-3520","","10.1109/TSE.2020.3048335","Mitacs(grant numbers:IT13813); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9311876","Automated builds;build systems;continuous integration","Acceleration;Software;Tools;Statistics;Sociology;Organizations;Testing","cache storage;graph theory;project management;public domain software;security of data;software development management;software libraries;software maintenance;software quality","continuous integration;caching environments;software development organizations;CI services;dependency graphs;hand-maintained graphs;commercial CI service;Kotinos acceleration;open source software systems;open-source software projects;historical CI;Kotinos approach;CI feedback;memory size 0.4 GByte to 5.2 GByte;efficiency 87.9 percent;efficiency 74.0 percent;efficiency 1.0 percent;memory size 2.0 MByte to 2.2 GByte","","2","","51","IEEE","31 Dec 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

As the security infrastructure in a firm grows, it needed a more complex management solution that would also scales to be able to function well. As there are security concepts to be considered, there are also management properties that cannot be ignored. While the security part helps the system function properly and securely, great management could boost productivity and eliminate unnecessary errors. Both concepts are equally important features to consider when designing an effective security management model. While it is important to have great understanding of what the system would do, it is also common that one would integrate tools to help maintain it. Tools can be used to either maintain standards or to help micromanages assets or resources available. As an example, the use of the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS), a scoring system that provides standardized way of capturing and producing quantitative score of a vulnerability would make a lot of processes easier to handle. While a ticketing or issue management tool could help manage tasks and resources laying around. In the end, the principal building blocks of the system itself could be simplified to both security and management models and integrated tools that serve the core aspect of the business process. One popular choice of such tools is Jira, an issue tracking application which can help to plan, track, and manage software development projects.","","978-1-6654-7327-9","10.1109/ICIMCIS56303.2022.10017933","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10017933","cyber security;framework;vulnerability;efficient;tools;management;ticketing;infrastructure","Productivity;Security management;System performance;Software;Internet of Things;Reliability;Computer crime","project management;security of data;software development management;software performance evaluation","Common Vulnerability Scoring System;complex management solution;CVSS;cyber security system performance;effective security management model;integrated tools;literature review;management models;management properties;quantitative score;security concepts;security infrastructure;software development projects;system function;ticketing","","","","24","IEEE","20 Jan 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

From IoT to extreme-scale computing data and computing have never been so distributed with the potential for real-time integration into these applications. The common theme to these applications, mostly composed of (big) data-integrated workloads, is their need to run in specialized environments for reasons such as on-demand or 24x7 nature of the tasks they are performing, and difficulties regarding their portability, latency, privacy, and performance optimization. Moreover, in many data-driven scientific applications, there is a need for heterogeneous integration of tasks requiring specialized computing capabilities with traditional high-throughput computing or high-performance computing tasks. Although some key middleware technologies enabled demonstration of standalone heterogeneous applications, such integration requires expertise convergence from a large group of people in very specialized settings. There are still many challenges for streamlined, scalable, repeatable, responsible, and explainable integration of data-integrated applications. Key opportunities for further innovations include intelligent systems and automated workflow management software that can compose and steer dynamic applications that can adapt to changing conditions in a data-driven fashion while integrating many tools to explore, analyze and utilize data. This talk will discuss some examples for data-integrated applications, describe emerging systems that enabled these applications, and overview our recent research to enable composable applications including a convergence application development methodology, intelligent middleware, and workflow composition.","1530-2075","978-1-6654-4066-0","10.1109/IPDPS49936.2021.00009","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9460393","","","","","","","","","IEEE","28 Jun 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This led to more applications of the highest quality. The selection committee finally had to select 10 outstanding contributors from a pool of 30+ highly competitive and strong nominations, which made the selection decisions rather difficult. After a careful and detailed selection process through many rounds of discussions via e-mails and live meetings, the committee voted unanimously on a short list of 10 top candidates who have all demonstrated outstanding achievements in different areas of AI. The selection was based solely on scientific quality, reputation, impact, and expert endorsements accumulated since their Ph.D. It is our honor and privilege to announce the following 2022 class of “AI’s 10 to Watch.”• Bo Li.
