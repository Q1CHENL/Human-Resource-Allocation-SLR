In the process of creating products and benefits in the enterprise, a network of working relationships is formed among employees in the organization. In this paper, we propose an approach to support decision-making on human resource allocation in an organization based on the human-centric network discovered from the event logs. To be more precise, the knowledge derived from human-centric networks formed through the operation phases of the information systems is used to make resource allocation strategies in the organizations. Using the appropriateness probabilities and social network metrics for allocating human resources, we clarify efficiently allocating resources based on different metrics. The system architecture and the scenarios are also described for planning human resources allocation based on these networks.

A process model may be redesigned by a rearrangement of various activities as per best practices to satisfy predefined business rules and constraints for a specific objective. This objective is stated in terms of functional goals like desired or acceptable process behavior, and nonfunctional goals such as cost, time, quality of service, and flexibility. Thus, many potential improvement possibilities that emerge through restructuring can be explored. When many such alternatives exist, there is a need for a formal methodology for evaluating these designs on various metrics to gain a deeper understanding of the tradeoffs involved. In this article, we describe a novel, formal methodology for optimizing the cost-benefit considerations within a space of possible redesigns to develop a cost vs. time efficient frontier.

This may result in an increase in the execution cost, flexibility restrictions, and a negative impact on the Quality of Service. In order to overcome these drawbacks, we introduce the Vienna Platform for Elastic Processes on Containers (ViePEP-C). ViePEP-C is an elastic BPMS that uses containers instead of VMs for the execution of business process activities on cloud resources, leading to a more fine-grained execution environment. To achieve this, ViePEP-C offers cloud controller, monitoring and business process execution functionalities and provides a platform for different resource and task scheduling algorithms. To evaluate the benefits of ViePEP-C, we further present a resource and task scheduling algorithm and show that, by using containers as execution environment, the execution cost can be decreased by over 20 percent (compared to a state-of-the-art VM-based scheduling algorithm) while considering a high service level.","2168-7161","","10.1109/TCC.2019.2912613","Austrian Research Promotion Agency(grant numbers:854187); FFG(grant numbers:866270); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8695740","Cloud computing;containers;elastic processes;business process management","Containers;Cloud computing;Manufacturing processes;Business process management","business data processing;cloud computing;resource allocation;scheduling;virtual machines","business process management systems;fluctuating demand;computational resources;cloud resources;coarse-grained allocation;elastic BPMS;fine-grained execution environment;business process execution functionalities;task scheduling algorithm;VM-based scheduling algorithm;Vienna platform;ViePEP-C;container-based elastic process platform","","7","","56","IEEE","23 Apr 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

These applications are known for their real-time requirements under limited network and computing resources, thus it becomes a highly demanding task to transform and compute tremendous amount of raw data in a cloud center. The edge–cloud computing infrastructure allows a large amount of data to be processed on nearby edge nodes and then only the extracted and encrypted key features are transmitted to the data center. This offers the potential to achieve an end–edge–cloud-based big data intelligence for IoE in a typical two-stage data processing scheme, while satisfying a data security constraint. In this study, a deep-reinforcement-learning-enhanced two-stage scheduling (DRL-TSS) model is proposed to address the NP-hard problem in terms of operation complexity in end–edge–cloud Internet of Things systems, which is able to allocate computing resources within an edge-enabled infrastructure to ensure computing task to be completed with minimum cost. A presorting scheme based on Johnson’s rule is developed and applied to preprocess the two-stage tasks on multiple executors, and a DRL mechanism is developed to minimize the overall makespan based on a newly designed instant reward that takes into account the maximal utilization of each executor in edge-enabled two-stage scheduling.

However, models only express ideal behavior of business processes without any undesired or unexpected business routines. In order to fully model business behavior, some researchers use system logs in similarity measuring. But previous system-logs-based similarity measurements have limitations on: (1) satisfaction of algorithm properties, (2) distribution of similarity values, and (3) complexity of algorithm. In this article, we take the advantages of token logs in process behavioral similarity measuring. Firstly, the Token Log Profile, modeled with a relation matrix, is defined as an abstraction of the initial token logs. Then, similarity between business processes is calculated based on their Token Log Profiles according to the proposed algorithm. Besides, we extend the properties that similarity algorithms should satisfy for evaluating the proposed algorithm.

Compared to cloud computing, fog computing focuses on ubiquitous connected heterogeneous devices and addresses the transmission latency by placing the fog nodes at the network edge. Concerning the limited resources of fog nodes enable the computationally intensive tasks to offload on the cloud resources. Scheduling of deadline-constrained workflows with minimum execution cost is challenging due to complex and uncertain computation offloading problems. Therefore, an intelligent fuzzy scheduler is designed to offload tasks characterized with uncertain parameters to the appropriate resources. A new salp swarm algorithm has been exploited to learn and optimize fuzzy task-resource allocation rules. In addition to this, to overcome the shortcomings of the salp swarm algorithm, it is employed with one of the best opposition methods named: Fitness-based quasi-reflection method. The inclusion of the opposition method enhances the proposed ISSS-FQR (Intelligent salp swarm scheduler with the fitness-based quasi-reflection method) approach and improves the learning process. Simulation studies on the benchmark workflows are carried out to demonstrate the efficacy of ISSS-FQR. ISSS-FQR has been compared with the classical algorithms, including chemical reaction optimization and ant colony optimization algorithms for workflow scheduling problems (CR-AC), Cost-Makespan aware scheduling (Deadline-based CMaS), and Directional and non-local convergent particle swarm optimization (DNCPSO). From the analyzed result, ISSS-FQR outperforms the rest of the classical algorithms, which proves the effectiveness of ISSS-FQR. Note to Practitioners—This paper provides a novel method called ISSS-FQR for minimizing the cost of execution of IoT applications while satisfying the deadline constraint.

However, due to the limited capacity of edge servers (ESs) and the dynamic computing requirements, the system needs to dynamically update the task allocation policy according to real-time system states. Service migration is essential to ensure service continuity when implementing dynamic task allocation. Therefore, this article investigates the long-term dynamic task allocation and service migration (DTASM) problem in edge-cloud IoT systems where users’ computing requirements and mobility change over time. The DTASM problem is formulated to achieve the long-term performance of minimizing the load forwarded to the cloud while fulfilling the seamless migration constraint and the latency constraint at each time of implementing the DTASM decision. First, the DTASM problem is divided into two subproblems: 1) the user selection problem on each ES and 2) the system task allocation problem. Then, the DTASM problem is formulated as a Markov decision process (MDP) and an approach based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is proposed. To tackle the challenge of vast discrete action spaces for DTASM task allocation in the system with a mass of IoT users, a training architecture based on the twin-delayed deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) is employed. Meanwhile, each action is divided into a differentiable action for policy training and one mapped action for implementation in the IoT system.

Multi-processor heterogeneous system has been widely used for handling parallel workflow applications to advance the performance of system, in which efficient workflow scheduling and the choice of frequency for each task play key roles. However, most scheduling algorithms just focus on an optimal solution for every single task and may exclude optimal task priority sequence at the task sorting phase. Therefore, this paper proposes a Predictive Energy Consumption Scheduling (PECS) algorithm to match the frequency for each task. Firstly, the alterable time space is introduced to decompose the deadline of the whole workflow application into each task. Secondly, as the basis of allocation, Predictive Energy Consumption Matrix (ECM) is defined to predict the impact of current task allocation on the energy consumption of subsequent tasks.

Finally, all tasks in the same priority level of a processor are swapped in order, then a scheduling strategy is formed to minimize energy consumption.

Most existing works focus on mitigating interference in D2D communication only in physical space. However, the effect of user content preference on interference in social space is ignored. In this article, a satisfied matching-embedded Social Internet of Things (IoT) is proposed for content preference-aware resource allocation (SIoT-RA). The Social IoT architecture is explored for user social characteristic analysis scenarios to ensure credible data management. Specifically, the user’s content preference characteristics are modeled as the probability of selecting similar content in the social IoT by employing the Dirichlet process. A satisfied matching-based model is proposed and embedded into the architecture as the core algorithm to achieve content preference-aware resource allocation. This design not only helps to reduce interference from the perspective of social space but also realizes maximized and satisfactory resource allocation performance by a matching algorithm that can quantify satisfaction as perceived utility. Extensive simulation results demonstrate the significant performance gains and high cost effectiveness of the proposed core algorithm of SIoT-RA in terms of the weighted sum data rate and users matching satisfaction.","2327-4662","","10.1109/JIOT.2021.3113914","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61901067,61901011,61701125); Chongqing Municipal Natural Science Foundation(grant numbers:cstc2020jcyj-msxmX0339); Science and Technology Research Program of Chongqing Municipal Education Commission(grant numbers:KJQN201900824,KJQN202000811); Chongqing Technology and Business University Foundation(grant numbers:1952002,1956011); National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2020YFB1807801); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9542946","Content preference;device-to-device (D2D) communication;matching algorithm;resource allocation;satisfaction;Social IoT","Resource management;Device-to-device communication;Internet of Things;Interference;Sensors;Quality of service;Games","cellular radio;human computer interaction;Internet of Things;mobile computing;probability;resource allocation","content preference-aware resource allocation;D2D underlaying cellular networks;diverse social content access;device-to-device communication;cellular spectrum resources;user content preference;social space;social IoT architecture;user social characteristic analysis scenarios;similar content;satisfied matching-based model;satisfactory resource allocation performance;satisfied matching-embedded social Internet of Things","","","","33","IEEE","21 Sep 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Accordingly, traditional project management methodologies advocate formal planning as an essential process in any project.

In this article, we question when formal planning is effective, when it is counterproductive, and which planning approach (strategic or tactical) is more effective for various project risk levels and performance dimensions (efficiency and effectiveness). Results from analyzing 2002 projects suggest that strategic planning has a higher value than tactical planning. Furthermore, tactical planning has a negative impact on project efficiency in low-risk projects as it increases project duration and cost but adds little value. In practice, in low-risk projects, managers may limit their focus on counterproductive tactical practices, such as risk, and procurement planning, and focus instead on long-term strategic planning, such as human resources planning. Theoretically, this article sets boundaries of effectiveness for planning-performance theory and advances the literature on the planning fallacy.","1558-0040","","10.1109/TEM.2021.3053585","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9354350","Project management;project planning;risk","Planning;Project management;Strategic planning;Organizations;Monitoring;Decision making;Australia","organisational aspects;planning;procurement;project management;risk management;strategic planning","counterproductive tactical practices;formal planning process;human resources planning;long-term strategic planning;low-risk projects;planning approach;planning fallacy;planning-performance theory;procurement planning;project duration;project efficiency;project planning;project risk levels;tactical planning;traditional project management methodologies","","1","","105","IEEE","15 Feb 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Due to the large number of container instances running in the platform, complex dependency relationship, fast version iteration and other characteristics, the update of business can often cause the change of the whole cloud resource environment, which triggers the repetitive scheduling problem of related tasks and affects stability of the business. In this paper, we propose a self-adapting task scheduling algorithm (ADATSA) using learning automata to solve these problems. Firstly, we design a learning automata model and objective function for the system on task scheduling problem. Then, we realize an effective reward-penalty mechanism for scheduling actions in combination with the idle state of resources and the running state of tasks in the current environment. Meanwhile, the environment is modeled by cluster, node and task, and the probability of action selected is optimized by scheduling execution, thus enhancing the adaptability to the cloud environment of the scheduling and accelerating convergence. Finally, we construct a framework of task load monitoring with buffer queue to achieve dynamic scheduling based on priority. The experimental part verifies the effectiveness of proposed algorithm with different angles such as resource imbalance degree, resource residual degree and QoS. Compared with other learning automata scheduling models such as LAEAS, non-automata technology based algorithms such as PSOS and K8S scheduling engine, ADATSA shows the better performance of environment adaptability, resource optimization efficiency and QoS in dynamic scheduling.

Task scheduling problem is considered one of the most critical cloud computing challenges. The problem refers to how to reasonably order and allocate the applications tasks provided by the users to be executed on virtual machines. Furthermore, the quality of scheduling performance has a direct effect on customer satisfaction. The task scheduling problem in cloud computing must be more accurately described in order to improve scheduling performance. In this paper, a multi-objective task scheduling algorithm is proposed based on the decision tree in a heterogenous environment. We introduce a new Task Scheduling-Decision Tree (TS-DT) algorithm for allocating and executing an application’s task.

This is mainly because ground-truth process models are usually unknown. To attack this problem, we pay a closer look to several concepts and implicit assumptions in the log completeness estimation problem and characterize it as a special case of the species estimation problem in the field of statistics. Although species estimation is still an open problem, a number of statistic models and techniques with approximate solutions have been available. To investigate the relevance of these methods for event log completeness estimation, we have designed and conducted a wide scope of empirical study and quantitative experiments on both real-world and synthesized event logs to compare the performance of these methods.

Forecasting models learn by minimizing a loss function that stands as a proxy for task-specific costs (e.g., trading, scheduling) without considering the downstream optimization, which in practice creates a performance bottleneck and obscures the impact of data on decisions. This work proposes a single data-driven module that leverages the structure of the optimization component and directly learns a policy conditioned on explanatory data. For this purpose, we describe an algorithm to train ensembles of decision trees by directly minimizing task-specific costs, and prescribe decisions via a weighted Sample Average Approximation of the original problem. We then develop a generic framework to assess the impact of explanatory data on prescriptive performance. To illustrate the efficacy of the proposed modeling approach, we consider two case studies related to trading renewable energy. First, we examine trading in a day-ahead market and propose strategies that balance optimal trading decisions and predictive accuracy. Next, we append a storage device and co-optimize the day-ahead offers and the operational policy, based on a tractable approximation using the linear decision rule approach. The empirical results demonstrate improved prescriptive performance compared to solutions derived under the standard stochastic optimization framework. Further, we provide valuable insights on how explanatory data impact optimization performance and how this impact evolves under different market designs.","1558-0679","","10.1109/TPWRS.2022.3152667","ADEME’s; Investissement d’Avenir; ERA-Net SES RegSys Program(grant numbers:646039); Smart4RES Project(grant numbers:864337); Horizon 2020 Framework Program; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9716858","Data-driven optimization;decision trees;energy forecasting;energy storage system;energy trading;linear decision rules;prescriptive analytics","Forecasting;Optimization;Predictive models;Renewable energy sources;Energy storage systems;Uncertainty;Decision trees","decision trees;learning (artificial intelligence);optimisation;power markets;power system planning;stochastic processes;stochastic programming","downstream optimization;single data-driven module;optimization component;decision trees;task-specific costs;prescribe decisions;weighted Sample Average Approximation;prescriptive performance;trading renewable energy;day-ahead market;balance optimal trading decisions;storage device;day-ahead offers;linear decision rule approach;standard stochastic optimization framework;explanatory data impact optimization performance;prescriptive trees;integrated forecasting;deriving decisions;sequential process;forecasting models;loss function","","6","","44","IEEE","18 Feb 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The study also explores the impact of demographic characteristics as moderating factors between the religious factors and perceptions of GRP systems in Saudi government agencies. Not many studies have been conducted on religious values concerning to what extent technological innovation is embraced. Most research on the effects of cultural norms has been conducted in Western countries and little has been published on Arab nations. This research fills that knowledge gap by investigating the effect of religious values on public sector employees’ adoption of technological innovation in Saudi Arabia. Theoretically, this study related to religious factors will facilitate an understanding of the issues affecting individual employees’ adoption of new technologies in the workplace context where conservative social and religious values hold sway. The study developed a conceptual model based on two theories: Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology and Theory of Reasoned Action. The sample data comprised 340 responses to an online survey questionnaire sent to employees at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Saudi Arabia. Data were analyzed using multivariate statistical analysis. Results show that 37% of the variance ( ${\mathrm {R}}^{2}=.372$ ) of employees’ attitudes to GRP application can be explained by the effect of religious variables. Findings show that the religious factors - perfection (Itqan) (t (340) =7.678,  $\text{p} < 0.000$ ), cooperation (Ta’awun) (t (340) =4.007,  $\text{p} < 0.000$ ), and transparency (Shaffaf) (t (340) =4.700,  $\text{p} < 0.000$ ) exerted a significant effect on users’ attitude to the system’s usage. However, responsibility (Mas’uliyyah (t (340) =1.284,  $\text{p} < 0.200$ ) did not reveal any level of significance. This research will help managers identify and benchmark strategies to motivate technology adoption in their workplaces and customize them to best fit their users’ unique characteristics in a traditional and conservative society such as Saudi Arabia.

Although, during these last years, autonomic management of cloud services has received increasing attention, the optimization of autonomic managers to be assigned to cloud services remains not well explored. In fact, almost all the existing solutions on autonomic computing have been interested in modeling and implementing autonomic mechanisms without making any effort to optimize the number of used autonomic managers. Moreover, when it comes to large service-based business processes, optimization of management resources becomes a critical issue. To overcome this issue, we present in this paper a novel approach to determine how many autonomic managers to use for the management of large service-based business processes in order to minimize their cost while avoiding management bottlenecks.

We study the joint optimization of computation offloading and resource allocation (CORA) with the objective of minimizing the system cost of processing tasks subject to the processing delay and transmission rate constraints. To attack the challenges brought by the dynamic environment, we use the Markov decision process model for formulating the dynamic optimization problem, and apply a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) technique to deal with high-dimensional and continuous states and action spaces. Then, we design a CORA algorithm, which is able to effectively learn the optimal scheme by adapting to the network dynamics. Extensive simulation experiments are conducted, in which we compare the CORA algorithm with both non-DRL algorithms and DRL algorithms.

The leakage can happen while the data is at rest (in storage), in processing, or on moving within a cloud or between different cloud infrastructures, e.g., from private to public clouds. This paper focuses on protecting data “in processing”. For big data applications, the MapReduce framework has been proven as an efficient solution and has been widely deployed, e.g., in healthcare and business data analysis. In this article, we propose a trust-based framework for MapReduce in big data processing tasks. Specifically, we first quantify and propose to assign the sensitive values for data and trust values for map and reduce slots. We then compute the trust value of each resource employed in the big data processing tasks. Depending on the data's sensitivity level of a task, the task requires a given level of trust (i.e., higher sensitive data requires servers/slots with higher trust level). The MapReduce scheduling problem is then formulated as the maximum weighted matching problem of a bipartite graph that aims to maximize the total trust value over all possible assignments subject to various trust requirement of different tasks. The problem is known to be NP-hard. To tackle it, we observe that within a computing node (VM), slots share the same trust value granted from the secured transformation phase. This helps reduce the number of slot nodes of a weight bipartite graph. Leveraging this fact, we propose an efficient heuristic algorithm that achieves 94.7 percent of the optimal solution obtained via exhaustive search. Extensive simulations show that the trust-based scheduling scheme provides much higher protection for data sensitivity while ensuring good performance for big data applications.","1939-1374","","10.1109/TSC.2019.2938959","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8823036","Trust-aware framework;data sensitive;big data security;trust-based scheduling;MapReduce","Cloud computing;Task analysis;Processor scheduling;Security;Big Data applications;Measurement;Data privacy;Heuristic algorithms;Trusted computing","Big Data;cloud computing;computational complexity;data analysis;data privacy;graph theory;parallel processing;resource allocation;scheduling;virtual machines","trust-based scheduling framework;private data;public clouds;big data applications;MapReduce framework;healthcare;business data analysis;trust-based framework;big data processing tasks;higher sensitive data;trust level;MapReduce scheduling problem;total trust value;trust requirement;data sensitivity;higher sensitive data","","6","","33","IEEE","3 Sep 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The software development methodologies have evolved where customer requirements are not initially locked but are flexible to take into account ongoing additional requirements or changes. In this regard, ‘new employee addition’ has emerged as one of the critical dynamic events that could significantly disrupt the project budget and schedule. In this paper, the SPS is modelled as multi-objective optimization problem and a novel approach is presented to deal with ‘new employee addition’ dynamic event; that uses domain knowledge to generate a robust schedule. The proposed heuristic is further evaluated on 18 dynamic benchmark scenarios and 3 real-world instances. The results show that the proposed heuristic besides its capability to handle dynamic events also demonstrates good convergence while maintaining good distribution of solutions in a dynamic environment.

In this article, we present a novel approach to design and control smart manufacturing systems. The approach is reactive, that is responds to unplanned situations and implements an iterative refinement technique, that is, optimizes itself during runtime to better accommodate production goals. For realizing these advances, we present a model-driven methodology and we provide a prototypical implementation of such a production system. In particular, we employ Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL) as our artificial intelligence environment for automated planning of production processes and combine it with one of the most prominent Industry 4.0 standards for the fundamental production system model: IEC 62264. We show how to plan the assembly of small trucks from available components and how to assign specific production operations to available production resources, including robotic manipulators and transportation system shuttles. Results of the evaluation indicate that the presented approach is feasible and that it is able to significantly strengthen the flexibility of production systems during runtime. Note to Practitioners—Smart production is an umbrella for a number of shifts and initiatives that deal with digitization of manufacturing/production systems and related issues and potentials. In this work, we present an approach for utilizing automated planning for creating production plans. This is in contrast to the traditional approach, where recipes are programmed into the production system ahead-of-time. However, automated planning relies on specific languages and tools that are hard to master by nonexperts, which is a factor that strongly limited the utilization of plan-driven approaches for industrial automation in practice. Thus, we propose to generate planning tasks automatically with model-driven engineering techniques. We are utilizing the industrial standard IEC 62264 for the description of the production system, and the academic standard Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL) for planning. PDDL is handled completely transparent to the user, that is the user is shielded from its complexity by employing the IEC 62264 model as the sole frontend.","1558-3783","","10.1109/TASE.2020.3018402","Austrian Federal Ministry for Digital and Economic Affairs; Österreichische Nationalstiftung für Forschung, Technologie und Entwicklung; Ministry of Education, Youth and Sport of the Czech Republic within the project Cluster 4.0(grant numbers:CZ.02.1.01/0.0/0.0/16_026/0008432); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9190077","Artificial intelligence (AI);computer-aided engineering;flexible manufacturing systems;information processing;iterative methods;systems modeling","Planning;Production systems;Unified modeling language;IEC Standards;Automation","artificial intelligence;control engineering computing;IEC standards;intelligent manufacturing systems;manufacturing systems;planning;planning (artificial intelligence);production control;production engineering computing;production planning;software engineering;specification languages","robotic manipulators;transportation system shuttles;Practitioners-Smart production;production plans;production system ahead-of-time;plan-driven approaches;planning tasks;academic standard Planning Domain Definition Language;iterative plan refinement;reactive Smart manufacturing systems;Industry 4.0 production systems;production processes;iterative refinement technique;production goals;automated planning;fundamental production system model;specific production operations;available production resources","","15","","49","IEEE","9 Sep 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Task assignment and incentive design are two essential parts of crowdsensing. However, due to the semi-honest CS and malicious workers, there exist several security and fairness issues. First, during task assigning and reward distributing, CS can get the private information of both task requester and workers such as identity, attributes. Second, malicious workers who are unable to execute tasks can get the task content, which leaks task privacy. Third, most auction-based incentive mechanism only considers the biddings of workers and ignores the real capabilities of workers. To this end, we propose a privacy-preserving fine-grained task assignment scheme for the crowdsensing system. Moreover, we also design a novel incentive mechanism based on the capabilities of workers. To be specific, a ciphertext-policy attribute-based encryption (CP-ABE) scheme with the characteristics of hidden policy is adopted to select workers and protect the privacy that of both requirements and workers' attributes. We quantify the capabilities of workers based on the workers' attributes and further determine the workers' reward according to their capabilities. Detailed security analysis demonstrates that our proposed scheme can protect workers' identity privacy, attribute privacy, and data confidentiality.

However, in edge layers, incorrect resource allocation of computing and network resources will result in the waste of resources and low real-time performance. In this paper, a DDPG-Based (Deep deterministic policy gradient-based) edge resource allocation method for cloud-edge cooperation framework is proposed. Firstly, the cloud-edge cooperation framework is designed for different tasks. Secondly, the joint minimizing problem of latency and bandwidth usage caused by edge computing is modeled. To quickly solve the joint optimization problem, we convert it to MDP (Markov Decision Process).

Its challenges mainly come from three aspects: 1) a large number of tasks in a workflow cause large-scale decision variables; 2) the two optimization objectives are of quite different scales; 3) and cloud resources are heterogeneous and elastic. So far, many studies focus on adopting multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) to solve the cloud workflow scheduling problem without mining the domain knowledge. To make a good trade-off between the makespan and monetary cost, this paper puts forward a knowledge-driven multi-objective evolutionary workflow scheduling algorithm, abbreviated as KMEWSA, including two novel features. On the one hand, the structural knowledge of workflow is mined to simplify the large-scale decision variables into a series of small-scale components, such accelerating the convergence speed of MOEAs. On the other hand, the knowledge on the Pareto front range is mined to estimate the ideal and nadir points for the objective space normalization during the search process, which helps maintain population diversity for MOEAs. At last, based on twenty real-world workflows and parameters of Amazon EC2, extensive experiments are performed to compare the KMEWSA with three baseline algorithms. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the KMEWSA in balancing makespan and monetary cost for deploying workflows into cloud computing.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3139137","Key Research Project of Xuchang University: Design of Smart IoT Management and Control System at Substation Side Based on BIM Model and Edge Computing(grant numbers:2021zd004); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9664570","Cloud computing;workflow scheduling;multi-objective optimization;evolutionary algorithm","Task analysis;Cloud computing;Costs;Optimization;Computational modeling;Elasticity;Statistics","cloud computing;evolutionary computation;genetic algorithms;optimisation;Pareto optimisation;scheduling;workflow management software","domain knowledge;monetary cost;KMEWSA;structural knowledge;large-scale decision variables;small-scale components;MOEAs;objective space normalization;real-world workflows;baseline algorithms;cloud computing;multiobjective evolutionary scheduling algorithm;cloud workflows;conflicting optimization objectives;multiobjective optimization problem;multiobjective evolutionary algorithms;cloud workflow scheduling problem","","","","39","CCBY","28 Dec 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Proposed parameter is used to rank activities on a scale based on their criticality to develop a heuristic. It was observed that the proposed intelligent heuristic performed better on well-known benchmark datasets in terms of both lead times and computation time. An improvement of 1.5–2.5 percent was observed in traditional performance measure of order lead times while for non-traditional criterion measuring robustness, improvement of 30–35 percent was observed.

We first group the mobile users based on the connected components to improve the efficiency of double auction. Then we utilize the McAfee Double Auction to price the resource transactions. Finally, we split each winning mobile user of double auction into multiple virtual mobile users, and use the matching approach to calculate the resource allocation.

On this basis, a subchannel and power allocation method is designed. The proposed subchannel allocation scheme ensures that users can obtain the maximum gain on its subchannel, and the Lagrangian duality theory is introduced to solve the power allocation problem. Meanwhile, the edge computing is applied to the SAGVN, and the vehicles can offload the local tasks to the edge server. In order to reduce the delay in the offloading process, taking the time delay as a constraint condition can further optimize the communication performance.

Distributional representation for network parameters or value functions is usually an effective way to improve the exploration ability of the RL agent. However, directly changing the representation form of network parameters from fixed values to function distributions may cause algorithm instability and low learning inefficiency. Therefore, to accelerate and stabilize parameter distribution learning, a novel inference-based posteriori parameter distribution optimization (IPPDO) algorithm is proposed. From the perspective of solving the evidence lower bound of probability, we, respectively, design the objective functions for continuous-action and discrete-action tasks of parameter distribution optimization based on inference. In order to alleviate the overestimation of the value function, we use multiple neural networks to estimate value functions with Retrace, and the smaller estimate participates in the network parameter update; thus, the network parameter distribution can be learned. After that, we design a method used for sampling weight from network parameter distribution by adding an activation function to the standard deviation of parameter distribution, which achieves the adaptive adjustment between fixed values and distribution. Furthermore, this IPPDO is a deep RL (DRL) algorithm based on off-policy, which means that it can effectively improve data efficiency by using off-policy techniques such as experience replay. We compare IPPDO with other prevailing DRL algorithms on the OpenAI Gym and MuJoCo platforms. Experiments on both continuous-action and discrete-action tasks indicate that IPPDO can explore more in the action space, get higher rewards faster, and ensure algorithm stability.","2168-2275","","10.1109/TCYB.2020.3023127","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61976215,61772532,U1813203); National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2019YFA0706200,2019YFB1703600); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9216634","Exploration;inference;parameter distribution;reinforcement learning (RL)","Task analysis;Optimization;Training;Artificial neural networks;Linear programming;Inference algorithms;Markov processes","deep learning (artificial intelligence);inference mechanisms;multi-agent systems;optimisation;reinforcement learning","reinforcement learning;distributional representation;network parameters;value function;RL agent;parameter distribution learning;IPPDO;objective functions;neural networks;network parameter update;network parameter distribution;activation function;deep RL;inference-based posteriori parameter distribution optimization;continuous-action task;discrete-action task;probability;evidence lower bound","Algorithms;Learning;Neural Networks, Computer;Reinforcement, Psychology;Research Design","2","","48","IEEE","7 Oct 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The removal of irrelevant and redundant features from data while simultaneously avoiding information loss is the main objective of feature selection. Feature selection is possible using rough set theory and meta-heuristic algorithms. In this paper, a novel auction-based optimization algorithm (ABOA) is proposed to contribute to generating an effective algorithm with a good trade-off between exploration and exploitation. This new algorithm simulates the auction sale process, where bidders offer higher/lower amounts to outbid each other. Auctions are categorized into ascending auctions and descending auctions and thus respectively represent maximization and minimization problems in ABOA. In the first step of the ABOA after initialization, a predefined number of bidders is selected and an auction is performed between them. The winner is selected and another auction is performed between the winner and a predefined number of the winner’s neighbors. The winner of this round of auction is added to the winner list. This process is iterated until a predefined number of winners is found. Finally, one more auction is performed between all the winners on the winner list and the winner of that auction becomes the final winner. The algorithm with different parameter setting scenarios is tested on 25 benchmark test functions. The algorithm with the best results is then used to perform feature selection on 18 UCI datasets. The feature selection and classification accuracy results are compared with state-of-the-art results. The statistical analysis of the results proves the ability of the algorithm to solve optimization problems.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3098808","National University of Malaysia(grant numbers:DIP-2016-024); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9492077","Artificial intelligence;auction-based optimization algorithm;feature selection;rough set theory","Optimization;Feature extraction;Classification algorithms;Rough sets;Data mining;Task analysis","data mining;electronic commerce;learning (artificial intelligence);optimisation;pattern classification;rough set theory;statistical analysis","novel auction-based optimization algorithm;rough set feature selection;irrelevant features;redundant features;rough set theory;meta-heuristic algorithms;ABOA;auction sale process;ascending auctions;descending auctions;predefined number;winner list;final winner","","5","","70","CCBY","20 Jul 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In the mining process, miners compete for rewards through puzzle solving, where only the miner that first completes the process will be rewarded. Thus, miners may wish to pay higher price and use more communication resources in task offloading and more computation resources in task processing for latency reduction. However, there are risks for the miners not profiting from consuming more resources or paying a higher price, so miners are rational in blockchain systems. In order to maximize the rational total profit of all miners, we use an asynchronous advantage actor-critic (A3C) deep reinforcement learning algorithm to obtain the resource pricing and allocation, considering the stochastic properties of wireless channels, and the prospect theory is employed to strike a good balance between risks and rewards.

The main goal of this letter is to minimize the task loss rate (TLR) in unmanned-air-vehicle (UAV) assisted mobile edge computing (MEC) due to the timeout. Furthermore, to ensure an equal service opportunity for the IoTDs and an equal energy consumption (EC) level for the UAVs, the issues of the TLR-fairness between IoTDs and the EC-fairness between UAVs are also considered.

The data structures we designed can effectively meet all requirements that are brought due to tasks and participants gathering online. In addition, based on the designed data structures, we study online large-scale heterogeneous task allocation problem from three aspects: the computing pattern, the tree creation method, and the extension of matching strategy. Our best method (TsPY) is based on parallel computing in the computing pattern, adopts time first and then space in the tree creation method, and increases the short-distance first strategy in the matching strategy. Finally, we conducted detailed experiments under the conditions of different participant geographical distributions (i.e., uniform distribution, Gaussian distribution, and check-in empirical distribution), different sensing methods (i.e., participatory sensing and opportunistic sensing), and different recommendation methods (i.e., point recommendation and trajectory recommendation). The experimental results show that TsPY has a good performance in multiple indicators such as algorithm running time, task-participant matching rate, participant travel distance, and redundant tasks removed. Compared with serial computing, parallel computing can reduce the algorithm running time by more than 66% on average in our experimental environment. Compared with space first and then time, creating a tree based on time first and then space can increase task-participant matching rate by more than 13% on average.

Firstly, selecting the most suitable employees for transfer to an organizational unit (OU), that is without the employment of new candidates. Secondly, enabling an exchange of employees between OUs, constrained with the employees' skills and OUs requirements. Thirdly, avoiding overlapping of employees in OUs for a previously defined timeframe. Finally, the travelling time and distance have to be within the given limits. We demonstrate that the proposed platform is designed to process all available information and human-defined rules to (i) support the HR managers in planning and organising their strategic activities in a timely manner, (ii) speed up the candidate selection process within the organisation for more than 82%, (iii) provide several best alternatives for staff deployment from the employees, (iv) reduce operational costs for more than 87%, and (v) reduce the administrative burden of HR management (HRM).","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3059895","HECAT project, funded within the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research & innovation programme(grant numbers:870702); Slovenian Research Agency (ARRS) core research programme(grant numbers:P1-0383); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9355136","Decision support;identity and access management;human resources management;strategic management;redeployment","Business;Employment;Databases;Companies;Task analysis;Permission;Security","artificial intelligence;cost reduction;decision support systems;human resource management;organisational aspects;personnel;strategic planning","artificial intelligence;digital transformation;candidate selection process;disruptive decision support platform;reengineering;employees strategic transfer;human resources processes;organisationsal aspects;decision support platform;design engineering;operational cost reduction;HR management;HRM","","2","","14","CCBY","16 Feb 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, with the growing number of terminal devices requiring computation offloading to the edge servers, the network would be heavily congested and thus the performance would be degraded and unbalanced among multiple devices. In this paper, we propose the joint admission control and computation resource allocation in the MEC enabled SCN, and formulate it as a stochastic optimization problem. The goal is to maximize the system utility combining the throughput and fairness while bounding the queue. We decouple the original problem into three independent subproblems, which can be solved in a distributed manner without requiring the system statistical information. An admission control and computation resource allocation (ACCRA) algorithm is designed to obtain the optimal solutions of the subproblems. Theoretical analysis proves that the ACCRA algorithm can achieve the close-to-optimal system utility and reach the arbitrary tradeoff between the utility and the queue length.

One of the most important challenges in data processing is how to transfer the big batches of data between the servers to achieve fast responsiveness. Consequently, the underlying network plays a critical role in the performance of a big data analysis platform. Ideally, this network must use the shortest path that has the lowest amount of load, to transfer the large-scale data. To address this issue, we propose a software-defined networking (SDN) enabled scheduling method that uses the tabu search algorithm to schedule big data tasks.

This work aims to develop a general method for predicting seizures in specific patients through exploring the time-frequency correlation of features obtained from multi-channel EEG signals. We convert the original EEG signals into spectrograms that represent time-frequency characteristics by applying short-time Fourier transform (STFT) to the EEG signals. For the first time, we propose a dual self-attention residual network (RDANet) that combines a spectrum attention module integrating local features with global features, with a channel attention module mining the interdependence between channel mappings to achieve better forecasting performance. Our proposed approach achieved a sensitivity of 89.33%, a specificity of 93.02%, an AUC of 91.26% and an accuracy of 92.07% on 13 patients from the public CHB-MIT scalp EEG dataset.

The platform coordinating the MCS campaigns often engineers these choices by selecting MCS tasks to recommend to users and offering monetary or in-kind rewards to motivate their contributions to them. In this paper, we revisit the well-investigated question of how to optimize the contributions of mobile end users to MCS tasks. However, we depart from the bulk of related literature by explicitly accounting for the bounded rationality evidenced in human decision making. Bounded rationality is a consequence of cognitive and other kinds of constraints, e.g., time pressure, and has been studied extensively in behavioral science. We first draw on work in the field of cognitive psychology to model the way boundedly rational users respond to MCS task offers as Fast-and-Frugal-Trees (FFTs). With each MCS task modeled as a vector of feature values, the decision process in FFTs proceeds through sequentially parsing lexicographically ordered features, resulting in choices that are satisfying but not necessarily optimal. We then formulate, analyze and solve the novel optimization problems that emerge for both nonprofit and for-profit MCS platforms in this context. The evaluation of our optimization approach highlights significant gains in both platform revenue and quality of task contributions when compared to heuristic rules that do not account for the lexicographic structure in human decision making. We show how this modeling framework readily extends to platforms that present multiple task offers to the users. Finally, we discuss how these models can be trained, iterate on their assumptions, and point to their implications for applications beyond MCS, where end-users make choices through the mediation of mobile/online platforms.","1558-0660","","10.1109/TMC.2020.3023757","Hellenic Foundation for Research and Innovation; General Secretariat for Research and Technology(grant numbers:892); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9195750","Mobile crowdsensing;incentive allocation;bounded rationality;task recommendation;decision trees;user choice engineering","Task analysis;Decision making;Crowdsensing;Computational modeling;Resource management;Psychology;Mobile applications","behavioural sciences computing;decision making;mobile computing;optimisation;psychology;trees (mathematics)","task contributions;human decision making;multiple task offers;mobile crowdsensing platforms;MCS campaigns;optimization problems;fast-and-frugal-trees;cognitive psychology;behavioral science","","7","","38","IEEE","14 Sep 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Traditional cloud-based video analytics relies on large centralized clusters to ingest video streams. With edge computing, we can offload compute-intensive analysis tasks to nearby servers, thus mitigating long latency incurred by data transmission via wide area networks. When offloading video frames from the front-end device to an edge server, the application configuration (i.e., frame sampling rate and frame resolution) will impact several metrics, such as energy consumption, analytics accuracy and user-perceived latency. In this paper, we study the configuration selection and bandwidth allocation for multiple video streams, which are connected to the same edge node sharing an upload link. We propose an efficient online algorithm, called JCAB, which jointly optimizes configuration adaption and bandwidth allocation to address a number of key challenges in edge-based video analytics systems, including edge capacity limitation, unknown network variation, intrusive dynamics of video contents. Our algorithm is developed based on Lyapunov optimization and Markov approximation, works online without requiring future information, and achieves a provable performance bound. We also extend the proposed algorithms to the multi-edge scenario in which each user or video stream has an additional choice about which edge server to connect.

We address a scheduling problem of the robotic cell that determines a robot task sequence when two part types are processed in a different set of machines and all machines have variable processing times within a given interval. The objective is to minimize the makespan. This study proposes a learning-based method, i.e., a reinforcement learning (RL) approach, for the first time, to address a dual-gripper robotic cell scheduling problem. The problem is modeled with a Petri net, a graphical and mathematical modeling tool, which is used as an environment in RL. The states, actions, and rewards are defined by using flow shop scheduling properties, features from a Petri net, and knowledge from previous studies of scheduling robotized tools. Then, the RL approach is compared to the first-in-first-out (FIFO) rule, which is generally used in practice, a swap sequence, which is widely used for cyclic scheduling of dual-gripper robotic cells, and a lower bound. The extensive experiments show that the proposed method performs better than FIFO and the swap sequence; moreover, the gap between the makespan of the proposed method and the lower bound is not large. Note to Practitioners—We address a scheduling problem of dual-gripper robotic cells with two-part types when all machines have processing time variations. We propose an RL approach to obtain an efficient robot task sequence in order to minimize makespan. The proposed method is performed offline, and a robot task sequence is then obtained instantaneously. The proposed method performs better than the FIFO rule used in practice and the swap sequence used for cyclic scheduling of robotic cells.

The DIRS framework includes centralized training relying on the global information and distributed decision making by each agent deployed in each MEC server. Specifically, we first introduce a novel multiagent ensemble-assisted distributed deep reinforcement learning (DRL) architecture, which can simplify the overall neural network structure of each agent by partitioning the state space and also improve the performance of a single agent by combining decisions of all the agents. Second, we apply action refinement to enhance the exploration ability of the proposed DIRS framework, where the near-optimal state-action pairs are obtained by a novel Levy flight search. Finally, an imitation acceleration scheme is presented to pretrain all the agents, which can significantly accelerate the learning process of the proposed framework through learning the professional experience from a small amount of demonstration data.

We propose an innovative multicriteria model based on the goal programming approach for solving the optimal allocation of individuals to different groups. The model copes with human resources’ cost and human–machine trust. Indeed, we propose an aggregated measure of the attitude towards AI tools to be employed to support tasks in an organization: more precisely our index is based on three dimensions: technology acceptance, technology self-efficacy, and source credibility. By incorporating this index in a team formation model, each team can be guaranteed to have less resistance to change in adopting machine-based decisions, a scenario that will characterize the years to come. The proposed index can also be integrated into more complex and comprehensive models to support business transformation.","1558-0040","","10.1109/TEM.2021.3077195","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9442337","Artificial intelligence (AI);goal programming (GP);multiple criteria decision-making (MCDM);team formation;technology acceptance;organizational change;innovation drivers","Artificial intelligence;Tools;Context modeling;Indexes;Scheduling;Resource management;Psychology","artificial intelligence;decision making;groupware;human computer interaction;man-machine systems;mathematical programming;organisational aspects;technology acceptance model","AI tools;business transformation;decision-making process;digital transformation;goal programming model;human resources;human-artificial Intelligence collaboration;human-machine trust;innovative multicriteria model;machine-based decisions;organizational change;source credibility;team formation model;technology acceptance;technology self-efficacy;workplace","","9","","64","IEEE","26 May 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In recent years, deep learning has achieved fruitful results in RSIR. However, there are three major problems. The first problem is due to the imbalanced categories in RSIR data sets. Accordingly, a novel sample mining method is proposed. This method is based on top- $k$  “misplaced” samples (Top- $k$  MS) along the top- $k$  nearest neighbor decision boundary, rather than setting boundary threshold of sample mining and reducing the impact of artificial and objective factors on network training as usual. The second problem comes from the inconsistency between the loss reduction direction and the optimization direction. In response, we additionally propose a novel result ranking loss (RRL) according to the retrieval results in a batch. RRL is used as a plug-in and combined with other local losses. As a result, the retrieval accuracy improved significantly. For the third problem, processing a large number of high-resolution images will increase training time and cause network freeze. To solve the problem, this article proposes a global optimization model based on feature space and retrieval results (FSRR). More specifically, FSRR consists of local loss based on feature space and RRL based on retrieval results, and can be optimized in an end-to-end manner. Experimental results show that our proposed algorithm achieves the best performance when compared with other state-of-the-art deep RSIR algorithms on two benchmark data sets.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2020.3029334","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61841602); Provincial Science and Technology Innovation Special Fund Project of Jilin Province(grant numbers:20190302026GX); Jilin Province Development and Reform Commission Industrial Technology Research and Development Project(grant numbers:2019C054-4); Higher Education Research Project of Jilin Association for Higher Education(grant numbers:JGJX2018D10); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities for Jilin University (JLU); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9234667","Deep learning;fine-tune network;global optimization;large-scale remote sensing image retrieval (RSIR);local loss;result ranking loss (RRL);sample mining","Optimization;Feature extraction;Training;Remote sensing;Image retrieval;Unsupervised learning;Fans","Big Data;data mining;geophysical image processing;image classification;image retrieval;learning (artificial intelligence);optimisation;pattern classification;remote sensing","local loss;result ranking loss;remote sensing image retrieval;remote sensing big data;large-scale remote;data mining;fruitful results;RSIR data sets;sample mining method;top- k nearest neighbor decision boundary;loss reduction direction;optimization direction;RRL;retrieval results;retrieval accuracy;high-resolution images;global optimization model;state-of-the-art deep RSIR algorithms;benchmark data sets","","7","","56","IEEE","21 Oct 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Efficient extraction of useful information from the volumes of data has garnered growing interest from academics and the industry. Data mining research focuses on finding utility patterns in large datasets. But the inherent complications like frequent scans, creation of substantial candidate sets, etc. plague the mining process for large datasets. Distributive architecture-based approaches also prove inefficacious due to high communication overhead over iterations. High communication cost over data exchange both locally and remotely further aggravates the situation. We propose a Communication Cost Effective Utility-based Pattern Mining (CEUPM) algorithm based on the Spark framework to address this issue. Spark accelerates iterative scanning by storing scanned datasets in a memory abstraction called resilient distributed datasets (RDD). RDD operations need a redistribution of data among cluster nodes during processing. To minimize the communication cost incurred during the shuffle process, we adopt a search space division strategy based on data parallelism for a fair and effective task allocation across cluster nodes. Communication overhead is incurred during this redistribution or shuffle process while minimizing costs. Experimental results in four real datasets demonstrate that CEUPM considerably reduces shuffling overhead and outperforms other existing methods in terms of memory usage, communication cost, execution time, and scalability.","1558-2183","","10.1109/TPDS.2022.3221210","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9944926","Communication cost;distributed computing;high utility pattern mining;scalability;spark","Data mining;Costs;Sparks;Distributed databases;Task analysis;Cluster computing;Scalability","data mining;minimisation;pattern clustering","CEUPM;cluster nodes;communication cost effective utility-based pattern mining algorithm;cost minimisation;current digital era;data exchange;data mining research;data parallelism;distributive architecture-based approaches;high-communication cost;information transmission technologies;iterative scanning;mining process;RDD operations;resilient distributed datasets;scanned datasets;shuffle process;Spark;substantial candidate sets;utility patterns;utility-based distributed pattern mining algorithm","","1","","61","IEEE","10 Nov 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Experimental results show that the proposed method can identify diverse trip purposes by explaining their structures over trip attributes and outperform baselines in terms of log-likelihood and perplexity.

For this reason, we formulate the top- $k$  FPM problem in large geo-social networks. Specifically, we devise a novel framework for subgraph retrieval and FPM mining with a series of optimizations. First, we propose a neighboring-aware R-tree (NaR-Tree) index structure to alleviate the challenge of retrieving subgraphs from a large graph. NaR-Tree is a variant of R-tree in which each nonleaf tree node further maintains some edge statistics information for the rectangle related to it. Second, we define the concept of minimum image-based support of edges (MNIE). With the help of the NaR-Tree and MNIE-based pattern extension approach, a mining algorithm that addresses the problem of exponential candidate patterns is proposed.

However, such generic aesthetics models neglect the fact that users’ aesthetic preferences vary significantly depending on their unique preferences. Therefore, it is essential to tackle the issue for personalized IAA (PIAA). Since PIAA is a typical small sample learning (SSL) problem, existing PIAA models are usually built by fine-tuning the well-established generic IAA (GIAA) models, which are regarded as prior knowledge. Nevertheless, this kind of prior knowledge based on “average aesthetics” fails to incarnate the aesthetic diversity of different people. In order to learn the shared prior knowledge when different people judge aesthetics, that is, learn how people judge image aesthetics, we propose a PIAA method based on meta-learning with bilevel gradient optimization (BLG-PIAA), which is trained using individual aesthetic data directly and generalizes to unknown users quickly. The proposed approach consists of two phases: 1) meta-training and 2) meta-testing. In meta-training, the aesthetics assessment of each user is regarded as a task, and the training set of each task is divided into two sets: 1) support set and 2) query set. Unlike traditional methods that train a GIAA model based on average aesthetics, we train an aesthetic meta-learner model by bilevel gradient updating from the support set to the query set using many users’ PIAA tasks. In meta-testing, the aesthetic meta-learner model is fine-tuned using a small amount of aesthetic data of a target user to obtain the PIAA model.

To enhance the exploration ability of agent and simultaneously ensure the stability of parameter learning, we proposed a novel proximal parameter distribution optimization (PPDO) algorithm. On the one hand, PPDO enhances the exploration ability of RL agent by transforming NN parameter from a certain single value to a function distribution. On the other hand, PPDO accelerates the parameter distribution optimization by setting two groups of parameters. The parameter optimization is guided by evaluating the parameter quality change before and after the parameter distribution update. In addition, PPDO reduces the influence of bias and variance on the value function approximation by limiting the amplitude of the two consecutive parameter updates, which can enhance the stability of the parameter distribution optimization.

In this work, to remove the slowdowns in performance on multimodal tasks, we decouple the learning procedures of unimodal and multimodal networks by dynamically balancing the learning rates for various modalities, so that the modality-specific optimization algorithm for each modality can be obtained. Specifically, the adaptive tracking factor (ATF) is introduced to adjust the learning rate for each modality on a real-time basis. Furthermore, adaptive convergent equalization (ACE) and bilevel directional optimization (BDO) are proposed to equalize and update the ATF, avoiding sub-optimal unimodal representations due to overfitting or underfitting.

However, the challenge is to process the surveillance video streams as soon as possible without ignoring any emergencies. This issue can be formulated as a two-stage scheduling problem, which is an NP-hard problem that can be integrated with higher level enterprise systems for operational efficiency improvement.

A dense reward function based on a concrete state representation is designed to tackle the sparse reward challenge and to speed up the convergence in actual large-scale task scheduling process. A prioritized replay scheme is then developed to improve the sampling efficiency, so as to effectively reduce the training time in deep reinforcement learning for the optimal two-stage scheduling.

The application of association rule mining in healthcare data has been widespread to this point in time. Most applications focus on positive association rules, ignoring the negative consequences of particular diagnostic techniques. When it comes to bridging divergent diseases and drugs, negative association rules may give more helpful information than positive ones. This is especially true when it comes to physicians and social organizations (e.g., a certain symptom will not arise when certain symptoms exist). Data mining in healthcare must be done in a way that protects the identity of patients, especially when dealing with sensitive information. However, revealing this information puts it at risk of attack. Healthcare data privacy protection has lately been addressed by technologies that disrupt data (data sanitization) and reconstruct aggregate distributions in the interest of doing research in data mining. In this study, metaheuristic-based data sanitization for healthcare data mining is investigated in order to keep patient privacy protected. It is hoped that by using the Tabu-genetic algorithm as an optimization tool, the suggested technique chooses item sets to be sanitized (modified) from transactions that satisfy sensitive negative criteria with the goal of minimizing changes to the original database. Experiments with benchmark healthcare datasets show that the suggested privacy preserving data mining (PPDM) method outperforms existing algorithms in terms of Hiding Failure (HF), Artificial Rule Generation (AR), and Lost Rules (LR).","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3192447","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9832893","Privacy-preserving data mining;healthcare data;evolutionary computation;sanitization process","Medical services;Data privacy;Genetic algorithms;Databases;Optimization;Data integrity;Task analysis","data mining;data privacy;diseases;genetic algorithms;health care;medical information systems;search problems","privacy preserving data mining framework;negative association rules;healthcare informatics;healthcare information;data custodians;association rule mining;positive association rules;negative consequences;helpful information;sensitive information;healthcare data privacy protection;metaheuristic-based data sanitization;healthcare data mining;patient privacy;sensitive negative criteria;benchmark healthcare datasets;suggested privacy;Artificial Rule Generation;Lost Rules","","6","","64","CCBY","19 Jul 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Meanwhile, many popular models are keen to execute detection and feature extraction tasks in parallel. But these two tasks will conflict with each other when optimized respectively. Therefore, we propose our tracker MOTFR to solve the above problems. In this paper, we propose a Locally Shared Information Decoupling Module (LSIDM) to reduce task optimization conflicts while ensuring the necessary information sharing. Meanwhile, a feature recoding module for deep extraction of identity discriminative features is proposed, which is called the Feature Purification Module (FPM). By combining LSIDM and FPM modules, the model utilizes the discriminative appearance features to guide the optimization of detection and further improves the performance of our model. To solve the problem of targets disappearing due to various abnormal occlusion, a Short-term Trajectory Online Complement Strategy (STOCS) is proposed to realize the trajectories continuation of these targets in the tracking stage.

In this paper, we design the weighted cross-modal attention mechanism, which not only captures the temporal correlation information and the spatial dependence information of each modality, but also dynamically adjusts the weight of each modality across different time steps. And the unimodal subtasks are led for assisting the representation learning of specific modality to jointly train the multimodal tasks and unimodal subtasks to explore the complementary relationships of each modality.

The blockchain mining process requires high computing power to solve a Proof-of-Work (PoW) puzzle, which is hard to implement on users’ mobile devices. So these miners may leverage the edge/cloud service providers (ESPs/CSP) to calculate the PoW puzzle. The existing edge-assisted blockchain networks assumed that all ESPs have a uniform propagation delay, which is unrealistic. In this article, we consider a more practical scene where ESPs locate in diverse positions of the blockchain network, which causes different propagation delays when supporting the computation of the PoW puzzle. Additionally, these ESPs connect to a remote CSP for resource scheduling when the computing tasks exceed their maximum capacity. The blockchain mining process generally involves complicated competition and games among CSP, ESPs, and miners. Each service provider focuses on how to determine his resource price so that he can maximize his utility. According to the set resource price, each miner concentrates on scheduling his resource requests for each ESP to maximize individual personal utility, which depends on ESPs’ resource price and propagation delays. We first model such a resource pricing and scheduling problem as a three-stage multi-leader multi-follower Stackelberg game and aim at finding the Stackelberg equilibrium. Then, we analyze the subgame optimization problem in each stage and propose an iterative algorithm based on backward induction to achieve the Nash equilibrium of the Stackelberg game.

However, existing workflow authorization models have some limitations. First, most of the existing research focuses on static workflows, where an order arriving at a workflow traverses tasks in a fixed sequence. In many real applications, however, task routing is not deterministic, having a probability distribution or pattern that may be estimated from historical data. Second, existing research ignores practical resource constraints, like user utilization, order waiting time, etc. To address the limitations, this article studies the workflow authorization model under the more realistic dynamic settings.

However, it is difficult to obtain optimal offloading decisions by conventional heuristic optimization methods, because the decision-making problem is usually NP-hard. In addition, there are shortcomings in using intelligent decision-making methods, e.g., lack of training samples and poor ability of migration under different MEC environments.

Thus, in this paper, a Radial Basis Function Neural Network (RBFNN) trained using Manta Ray Foraging Optimization algorithm (MRFO) is proposed. RBFNN is a three-layer network comprising of input, output, and hidden layers that can process large amounts. The trained network can discover hidden data patterns in unseen data. The learning algorithm and seed selection play a vital role in the performance of the network. The seed selection is done using the spectral indices to further improve the performance of the network. The manta ray foraging optimization algorithm is inspired by the intelligent behaviour of manta rays. It emulates three unique foraging behaviours namelys chain, cyclone, and somersault foraging. The satellite images contain enormous amount of data and thus require exploration in large search space. The spiral movement of the MRFO algorithm enables it to explore large search spaces effectively. The proposed method is applied on pre and post flooding Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) images of New Brunswick area. The method was applied to identify and classify the land cover changes in the area induced by flooding. The images are classified using the proposed method and a change map is developed using post classification comparison. The change map shows that a large amount of agricultural area was washed away due to flooding. The measurement of the affected area in square kilometres is also performed for mitigation activities. The results show that post flooding the area covered by water is increased whereas the vegetated area is decreased. The performance of the proposed method is done with existing state-of-the-art methods.","2096-0654","","10.26599/BDMA.2022.9020027","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9962957","Radial Basis Function Neural Network (RBFNN);Manta Ray Foraging Optimization algorithm (MRFO);Landsat 8;classification;change detection;disaster mitigation;planning","Training;Satellites;Spirals;Radial basis function networks;Agriculture;Classification algorithms;Floods;Task analysis;Optimization;Image classification","agriculture;geophysical image processing;image classification;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;radial basis function networks;remote sensing","data patterns;enormous data;hidden layers;hybrid Manta Ray Foraging Optimization Neural Network;image classification method;learning algorithm;Manta Ray Foraging Optimization algorithm;MRFO algorithm;post classification comparison;Radial Basis Function Neural Network;RBFNN;satellite image classification;satellite images;search space;seed selection;somersault foraging;trained network","","","","22","","24 Nov 2022","","","TUP","TUP Journals"

Existing approaches assume the human has a specific goal during the cooperation, and the robot infers and acts toward it. However, in real-world environments, a human usually only has a general goal (e.g., general direction or area in motion planning) at the beginning of the cooperation, which needs to be clarified to a specific goal (i.e., an exact position) during cooperation. The specification process is interactive and dynamic, which depends on the environment and the partner’s behavior. The robot that does not consider the goal specification process may cause frustration to the human partner, elongate the time to come to an agreement, and compromise team performance. This work presents the Evolutionary Value Learning approach to model the dynamics of the goal specification process with State-based Multivariate Bayesian Inference and goal specificity-related features. This model enables the robot to enhance the process of the human’s goal specification actively and find a cooperative policy in a Deep Reinforcement Learning manner.

The study of sediment classification in this area will help to further explain topographic evolution and dynamic mechanism. Aiming at the complex mixed sediment environment in the ancient valley area of shallow seas, an advanced deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) classification model based on transfer learning—selective kernel hybrid dilated ResNet-50 (SKHD-ResNet-50) is thus proposed and applied to the coastal area in the firth of forth, Scotland, U.K. The model overcomes problems of low accuracy of sediment classification with small samples, while effectively improving the efficiency of mixed sediment classification. Five transferred convolutional neural network models, including CNN, AlexNet, VGG-19, GoogleNet, and SKHD-ResNet-50, were used to conduct seabed sediment classification experiments on multibeam backscatter mosaics in the study area. An ablation study about the effect of selective kernel convolution (SKC) and hybrid dilated convolution (HDC) was also conducted to further prove the usability of the proposed method. Finally, the optimized convolutional neural network was used to build a multilayer deep learning model for sediment classification, combining the transfer learning method with the neural network to obtain the optimal network weights through deep global optimization, thus accurately mining statistical characteristics and distribution rules of backscatter intensity data. The experimental results show that the advanced model obtains better classification accuracy than that of state-of-art methods, with the overall accuracy and Kappa coefficient of 96.87% and 0.9482, respectively. Findings highlight the proposed sediment classification model, which can effectively distinguish mixed sediments, and greatly improve the accuracy and efficiency of sediment classification.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2023.3280243","National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2022YFC2806600,2022YFC2806603); Scientific Research Fund of the Second Institute of Oceanography, Ministry of Natural Resources, China(grant numbers:JG2203); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:41830540,42006073); Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang(grant numbers:LY21D060002,LY23D060007); Oceanic Interdisciplinary Program of Shanghai Jiao Tong University(grant numbers:SL2020ZD204,SL2022ZD205); Key Laboratory of Submarine Geoscience, Ministry of Natural Resources(grant numbers:KLSG2203,KLSG2106); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10136754","Ancient river valley;backscatter mosaics;convolutional neural network;sediment classification;transfer learning","Sediments;Convolutional neural networks;Backscatter;Convolution;Deep learning;Transfer learning;Task analysis","backscatter;convolutional neural nets;data mining;deep learning (artificial intelligence);feature extraction;geophysical image processing;image classification;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;sediments","advanced deep convolutional neural network classification model;ancient river valley;ancient valley area;classification accuracy;coastal area;complex mixed sediment environment;convolutional neural network models;hybrid dilated convolution;mixed seabed sediment classification;mixed sediment classification;mixed sediments;multilayer deep learning model;optimal network weights;optimized convolutional neural network;seabed sediment classification experiments;sediment classification model;selective kernel convolution;SKHD-ResNet-50;transfer learning method;transfer learning-selective kernel hybrid;transferred convolutional neural network","","","","45","IEEE","26 May 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Cloud computing provides services through Cloud Service Providers (CSPs). Cloud computing is mainly used for delivering solutions to a large number of business and scientific applications. Large-scale scientific applications are evaluated through cloud computing in the form of scientific workflows. Scientific workflows are data-intensive applications, and a single scientific workflow may be comprised of thousands of tasks. Deadline constraints, task failures, budget constraints, improper organization and management of tasks can cause inconvenience in executing scientific workflows. Therefore, we proposed a fault-tolerant and data-oriented scientific workflow management and scheduling system (FD-SWMS) in cloud computing. The proposed strategy applies a multi-criteria-based approach to schedule and manage the tasks of scientific workflows. The proposed strategy considers the special characteristics of tasks in scientific workflows, i.e., the scientific workflow tasks are executed simultaneously in parallel, in pipelined, aggregated to form a single task, and distributed to create multiple tasks. The proposed strategy schedules the tasks based on the data-intensiveness, provides a fault tolerant technique through a cluster-based approach, and makes it energy efficient through a load sharing mechanism. In order to find the effectiveness of the proposed strategy, the simulations are carried out on WorkflowSim for Montage and CyberShake workflows. The proposed FD-SWMS strategy performs better as compared with the existing state-of-the-art strategies. The proposed strategy on average reduced execution time by 25%, 17%, 22%, and 16%, minimized the execution cost by 24%, 17%, 21%, and 16%, and decreased the energy consumption by 21%, 17%, 20%, and 16%, as compared with existing QFWMS, EDS-DC, CFD, and BDCWS strategies, respectively for Montage scientific workflow.

A novel mobile blockchain network with the help of a mobile edge computing (MEC) server is presented, where all mobile users participate in the PoW mining process. The traditional Bitcoin network adjusts the target difficulty value to ensure a stable block time. However, for MEC-assisted mobile blockchain networks, the adjusted difficulty value needs to be broadcast to all mobile users, which results in expensive communication costs. To maintain a stable block time of mobile blockchain networks, we formulate the delay-limited computation offloading strategy of the PoW-based mining task as a non-cooperative game that maximizes an individual revenue in the MEC-assisted mobile blockchain network. Specifically, the non-cooperative game problem can be divided into multiple sub-game optimization problems to obtain final solutions for all users. We analyze the sub-game optimization problem and prove the existence of Nash equilibrium (NE) of the non-cooperative game. Moreover, we design an alternating iterative algorithm based on the continuous relaxation and greedy rounding (CRGR) to achieve the NE of this game. Given the sub-optimal delay-limited computation offloading results, we also derive the optimal transmit power for an individual user within the maximum mining delay range. From the analytical results, we can see that the proposed CRGR-based alternating iterative algorithm can efficiently attain the sub-optimal delay-limited computation offloading strategies of all mobile users in the polynomial time. The individual transmit power increases accordingly with the delay-limited computation offloading strategies of all users.

For this issue, this article proposes an adaptive reference vector reinforcement learning (RVRL) approach to decomposition-based algorithms for industrial copper burdening optimization. The proposed approach involves two main operations, that is: 1) a reinforcement learning (RL) operation and 2) a reference point sampling operation. Given the fact that the states of reference vectors interact with the landscape environment (quite often), the RL operation treats the reference vector adaption process as an RL task, where each reference vector learns from the environmental feedback and selects optimal actions for gradually fitting the problem characteristics. Accordingly, the reference point sampling operation uses estimation-of-distribution learning models to sample new reference points. Finally, the resultant algorithm is applied to handle the proposed industrial copper burdening problem. For this problem, an adaptive penalty function and a soft constraint-based relaxing approach are used to handle complex constraints.

Since there is usually no solution that optimizes all objectives simultaneously, the aim is to identify a solution with acceptable trade-offs. Interactive multiobjective optimization methods are iterative processes in which a human decision maker repeatedly provides one’s preferences to request computing new solutions and compares them. With these methods, the decision maker can learn about the problem and its limitations. However, advanced optimization software usually offer simple visualization tools that can be significantly improved. On the other hand, current approaches for multiobjective optimization from the visualization community provide superior visualization tools but lack advanced optimization. In this paper, we introduce a new term, interactivize, for integrating interactive multiobjective optimization and interactive visualization and present an interactivized approach supporting decision makers in visually steering interactive multiobjective optimization methods. We integrate state-of-the-art interactive visualization with the process of interactive multiobjective optimization in a visual analytics solution that significantly improves the analysis workflow of decision makers, like comparing selected solutions and specifying new preferences during the iterative solution process. To realize the new interactivized approach, we combine a coordinated multiple views system with DESDEO, an open-source software framework for interactive multiobjective optimization.

The efficiency of the classic AC architecture is limited due that the policy does not directly participate in the value function update. The classic AC architecture will make the value function estimation inaccurate, which will affect the performance of the PPO algorithm. For improvement, we designed a novel AC architecture with policy feedback (AC-PF) by introducing the policy into the update process of the value function and further proposed the PPO with policy feedback (PPO-PF). For the AC-PF architecture, the policy-based expected (PBE) value function and discount reward formulas are designed by drawing inspiration from expected Sarsa. In order to enhance the sensitivity of the value function to the change of policy and to improve the accuracy of PBE value estimation at the early learning stage, we proposed a policy update method based on the clipped discount factor. Moreover, we specifically defined the loss functions of the policy network and value network to ensure that the policy update of PPO-PF satisfies the unbiased estimation of the trust region. Experiments on Atari games and control tasks show that compared to PPO, PPO-PF has faster convergence speed, higher reward, and smaller variance of reward.","2168-2232","","10.1109/TSMC.2021.3098451","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61976215,61772532,U1813203); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9501950","Actor–critic (AC);clipped discount factor;policy feedback;proximal policy optimization (PPO);value function","Optimization;Estimation;Training;Task analysis;Trajectory;Space exploration;Games","convergence;deep learning (artificial intelligence);estimation theory;feedback;optimisation;reinforcement learning","AC-PF architecture;actor network;actor-critic architecture;Atari games;clipped discount factor;convergence speed;critic network;deep reinforcement learning algorithm;discount reward formula;loss function;PBE value estimation;PBE value function;policy feedback;policy network;policy update method;policy-based expected value function;PPO algorithm;PPO-PF;proximal policy optimization;value function estimation;value function update;value network","","2","","45","IEEE","29 Jul 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The L2,1 norm of a structure matrix can be utilized to explicitly reveal the correlations between multiple targets and an L2 term are attached to the cost function of SCN. Considering the nonsmoothness of the constructed cost function, an alternating optimization algorithm is adopted to compute the structure matrix and the output weights of MTSCN.

To tackle this problem, in this paper, we propose a novel approach called BuyerNorm which can identify different expression forms for a given buyer name. The proposed model takes pairs of variable length buyer names as input and combines Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) and Bi-directional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) to obtain string representations and calculate the similarity between the two names, which indicates whether they represent the same buyer. For this task, we first build a data set including more than 80,000 pairs of buyer names.

Most attention architectures cannot explore the discriminative person representations for VTReID, especially in the thermal modality. In addition, the fine-grained middle-level semantic information has received much less attention in the part-based approaches for the cross-modality pedestrian retrieval task, resulting in limited generalization capability and poor representation robustness. This paper proposes a simple yet powerful discriminative local representation learning (DLRL) model to capture the robust local fine-grained feature representations and explore the rich semantic relationship between the learned part features. Specifically, an efficient contextual attention aggregation module (CAAM) is designed to strengthen the discriminative capability of the feature representations and explore the contextual cues for visible and thermal modalities. Then, an integrated middle-high feature learning (IMHF) method is introduced to capture the part-level salient representations, which handles the ambiguous modality discrepancy in both discriminative middle-level and robust high-level information. Moreover, a part-guided graph convolution module (PGCM) is constructed to mine the structural relationship among the part representations within each modality. The quantitative and qualitative experiments on the two benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed DLRL model significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods and achieves rank-1/mAP accuracy of 92.77%/82.05% on the RegDB dataset and 63.04%/60.58% on the SYSU-MM01 dataset.","2637-6407","","10.1109/TBIOM.2022.3184525","National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2018AAA0100100); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61732012,62002266,61932008,62073231); Science and Technology Innovation 2030 Major Projects of China(grant numbers:2021ZD0201904); Introduction Plan of High-End Foreign Experts(grant numbers:G2021033002L); Key Project of Science and Technology of Guangxi(grant numbers:AA22068057,2021AB20147); Natural Science Foundation of Guangxi(grant numbers:2021JJA170204,2021JJA170199); Guangxi Science and Technology Base and Talents Special Project(grant numbers:2021AC19354,2021AC19394); China National Scientific Seafloor Observatory; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9803280","Person re-identification;cross-modality;middle-level features;attention mechanism;graph convolution","Feature extraction;Task analysis;Semantics;Cameras;Representation learning;Convolution;Training","convolutional neural nets;feature extraction;graph theory;image motion analysis;image representation;image retrieval;learning (artificial intelligence);object detection;video signal processing;video surveillance","cross-modality pedestrian retrieval task;cross-modality visible-thermal person re-identification;discriminative local representation learning model;discriminative person representations;efficient contextual attention aggregation module;fine-grained feature representations;fine-grained middle-level semantic information;integrated middle-high feature learning;intelligent video surveillance systems;part-guided graph convolution module;thermal modality;VTReID","","1","","62","IEEE","22 Jun 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Delays and bad recovery strategies after disasters or failures can lead to impairing impacts in terms of injury to people, environmental pollution and loss of time, money and resources. In such a context, the adoption of a spatial Decision Support System (DSS) might play a crucial role in order to help operators to adopt the best recovery strategy in the shortest possible time frame. Current approaches do not consider the problem of assigning an intervention location to a maintenance crew and do not account for the effective time needed for emergency intervention. In this paper we develop a novel spatial multi-criteria DSS methodology for prioritizing repair interventions on power networks. The multi criteria strategy is solved by the adoption of Incomplete Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) which computes holistic assignment costs as the result of the combination of multiple and possibly conflicting metrics of cost. Then, we use the holistic costs as the basis for a task assignment phase that is based on the Hungarian algorithm. The proposed strategy has been implemented as a module in the Decision Support System, namely Critical Infrastructure Protection Risk Analysis and Forecast (CIPCast), whose outputs are represented on a web-based Geographic Information System (GIS) platform.

Collaborative analysis technology can analyze multiple hyperspectral datasets to explore the inherent spectral features shared among them. In this letter, a multiple datasets collaborative analysis framework for hyperspectral band selection is proposed to realize spectral information communication, thereby guiding and promoting the band selection of each dataset. Different band selection tasks are established pertinently, and then, the evolutionary multitasking band selection method is designed to facilitate the knowledge sharing of different band selection tasks. More importantly, the interaction mechanism among different datasets is adjusted dynamically, thereby improving the cooperation ability of the collaborative analysis framework.

PhenoBERT uses BERT, currently the state-of-the-art NLP model, as its core model for evaluating whether a clinically relevant text segment (CTS) could be represented by an HPO term. However, to avoid unnecessary comparison of a CTS with each of ∼14,000 HPO terms using BERT, we introduce a two-levels CNN module consisting of a series of CNN models organized at two levels in PhenoBERT. For a given CTS, the CNN module produces only a short list of candidate HPO terms for BERT to evaluate, significantly improving the computational efficiency. In addition, BERT is able to assign an ancestor HPO term to a CTS when recognition of the direct HPO term is not successful, mimicking the process of HPO term assignment by human. In two benchmarks, PhenoBERT outperforms four traditional dictionary-based methods and two recently developed deep learning-based methods in two benchmark tests, and its advantage is more obvious when the recognition task is more challenging. As such, PhenoBERT is of great use for assisting in the mining of clinical text data.","1557-9964","","10.1109/TCBB.2022.3170301","National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2021YFC2301500); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:32170667,31871325); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9763337","BERT;biomedical ontologies;concept recognition;deep learning;human phenotype ontology;medical text mining","Bit error rate;Ontologies;Text recognition;Deep learning;Benchmark testing;Task analysis;Genetics","convolutional neural nets;data mining;deep learning (artificial intelligence);feature extraction;learning (artificial intelligence);natural language processing;ontologies (artificial intelligence);text analysis","automated recognition;BERT;clinical data mining;clinical text data;clinical texts;clinically relevant text segment;CNN models;combined deep learning method;core model;direct HPO term;given CTS;HPO term assignment;Human Phenotype Ontology terms;PhenoBERT;recently developed deep learning-based methods;recognition task;state-of-the-art NLP model;traditional dictionary-based methods;two-levels CNN module","Humans;Deep Learning;Benchmarking;Data Mining;Family;Phenotype","","","29","IEEE","26 Apr 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Specially, we consider the impact of time-varying task load and channel quality on UE’s motivation to engage in the FL task. We adopt the finite-state discrete-time Markov chain (FSDT-MC) to predict these parameters during the FL task.

Nowadays, most methods cast this task as a mapping problem, which learns a mapping from visual features to natural language and generates captions directly from videos. However, the underlying challenge of video captioning, i.e., sequence to sequence mapping across the different domains, is still not well handled. To address these problems, we introduce the polishing mechanism in an attempt to mimic human polishing process and propose a generate-and-polish framework for video captioning. In this paper, we propose a two-step transformer based polishing network (TSTPN) consisting of two sub-modules: the generation-module is to generate the caption candidate and the polishing-module is to gradually refine the generated candidate. Specifically, the candidate provides a global information of the visual contents in a semantically-meaningful order, where it is firstly considered as a semantic intersnubber to bridge the semantic gap between the text and video, with the cross-modal attention mechanism for better cross-modal modeling; and it secondly provides a global planning ability to maintain the semantic consistency and fluency of the whole sentence for better sequence mapping. In experiments, we present adequate evaluations to show that the proposed TSTPN achieves the comparable and even better performance than the state-of-the-art methods on the benchmark datasets.","1558-2205","","10.1109/TCSVT.2022.3165934","Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(grant numbers:2021RC216); NSFC(grant numbers:62006015,61672089,61971446,61572064,61906013); CEFLA Audio-Video Restoration and Evaluation Key Laboratory of Ministry of Culture and Tourism; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9751606","Video captioning;transformer;polishing mechanism;cross-modal modeling","Semantics;Visualization;Decoding;Transformers;Task analysis;Planning;Training","computer vision;feature extraction;learning (artificial intelligence);natural language processing;natural languages;path planning;polishing;text analysis;video signal processing","bridging video;two-step polishing transformer;video captioning;natural language processing;video content;natural language sentences;captions;sequence mapping;polishing mechanism;human polishing process;generate- polish framework;-polish framework;two-step transformer based polishing network;caption candidate;polishing-module","","","","58","IEEE","8 Apr 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Therefore, the processing speed of big data systems is more important than ever. On the other hand, protecting a big data system is not easy, as various types of nodes and clusters are supported by various wired and wireless networks. Commonly security procedures slow down the response time of big data networks, and therefore, enhanced security and performance speed techniques need to be co-designed into the system. In this paper, a trusted streaming adaptive failure-compensation (TSAF) scheme is proposed that uses a trust management scheme to identify malicious nodes in Spark big data systems, exclude them from job/task processing, and calculate the number of nodes that can satisfy the process’s object completion time. The TSAF scheme shows an improved processing performance when there are attacks on the big data system compared to other existing real-time big data processing schemes. For the case of no security attack, the results show that the processing time of TSAF is faster by about 1 ~ 2% compared to the existing big data processing schemes when the process completion object time is set to 0.5 s. Even when the ratio of malicious nodes performing security attacks on worker nodes reaches 0.5, the results show that TSAF can satisfy over 75% of the tasks within the object time, which is significantly higher compared to the existing big data processing schemes.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3129885","Ministry of Science and ICT (MSIT), South Korea, under the Information Technology Research Center (ITRC) support Program through the Institute for Information and Communications Technology Planning and Evaluation (IITP)(grant numbers:IITP-2021-2018-0-01799); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9623558","Trust management;big data;time bound optimization;real-time processing;security","Big Data;Trust management;Security;Computational complexity;Real-time systems;Databases;Data processing","Big Data;security of data;trusted computing","smart systems;response time;big data networks;performance speed techniques;malicious nodes;security attack;process completion object time;adaptive trust management;data process time optimization;real-time Spark big data systems;trust management;adaptive failure-compensation;trusted streaming adaptive failure-compensation;TSAF","","","","15","CCBY","22 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Self-supervised learning does not rely on a large amount of labeled data and reduces the loss of human labeled information. Compared with natural images, remote sensing images require rich samples and human annotation by experts. Moreover, many algorithms have poor interpretability and unconvincing results. Therefore, this article proposes a self-supervised method based on prototype assignment by designing a pretext task so that the network maps features to prototypes in the process of learning, swaps the code corresponding to the obtained features, combines them with another data-enhancing feature, and then optimizes the network. The prototype is introduced to explain the clustering idea embodied in the whole process. Considering the existence of the scene information-rich characteristic of remote sensing images, we introduce multiple views with different resolutions to capture more detailed information on the images. Finally, if the data enhancement method is not powerful enough, the network can easily fall into an overfitting state, which prevents the network from learning subtle differences and detailed information. To address this shortcoming, we propose a fusion strategy to flatten the decision boundary of the framework so that the model can also learn the soft similarity between sample pairs. We name the whole framework multiview fusion feature sample mining based on prototype clustering (MFPC). In extensive experiments conducted on three common remote sensing image datasets (i.e., UCMerced, AID, and NWPU45), MFPC achieves a maximum improvement of 4.3% over some existing self-supervised algorithms, indicating that it can achieve good results.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2022.3216831","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62171347,61877066,61771379,62001355,62101405); Foundation for Innovative Research Groups of the National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61621005); Key Research and Development Program in Shaanxi Province of China(grant numbers:2019ZDLGY03-05,2021ZDLGY02-08); Science and Technology Program, Xi’an, China(grant numbers:XA2020-RGZNTJ-0021); Higher Education Discipline Innovation Project; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9933708","Clustering idea;fusion strategy;interpretability;multiple views;prototype assignment;self-supervised learning","Remote sensing;Task analysis;Self-supervised learning;Prototypes;Training;Codes;Predictive models","data mining;geophysical image processing;image classification;image fusion;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;pattern clustering;remote sensing;unsupervised learning","common remote sensing image datasets;data enhancement method;data-enhancing feature;existing self-supervised algorithms;fusion feature sample mining;fusion strategy;human annotation;human labeled information;natural images;network maps features;poor interpretability;prototype assignment;prototype clustering;prototypes;remote sensing image scene classification;remote sensing images;rich samples;scene information-rich characteristic;self-supervised learning;self-supervised method;self-supervised visual representation learning;unconvincing results","","4","","47","IEEE","31 Oct 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this context, employee attrition presents a critical problem and a big risk for organizations as it affects not only their productivity but also their planning continuity. In this context, the salient contributions of this research are as follows. Firstly, we propose a people analytics approach to predict employee attrition that shifts from a big data to a deep data context by focusing on data quality instead of its quantity. In fact, this deep data-driven approach is based on a mixed method to construct a relevant employee attrition model in order to identify key employee features influencing his/her attrition. In this method, we started thinking `big' by collecting most of the common features from the literature (an exploratory research) then we tried thinking `deep' by filtering and selecting the most important features using survey and feature selection algorithms (a quantitative method). Secondly, this attrition prediction approach is based on machine, deep and ensemble learning models and is experimented on a large-sized and a medium-sized simulated human resources datasets and then a real small-sized dataset from a total of 450 responses. Our approach achieves higher accuracy (0.96, 0.98 and 0.99 respectively) for the three datasets when compared previous solutions. Finally, while rewards and payments are generally considered as the most important keys to retention, our findings indicate that `business travel', which is less common in the literature, is the leading motivator for employees and must be considered within HR policies to retention.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3074559","ERASMUS + KA2 Projects “Information Technology Governance for Tunisian Universities”(grant numbers:561614-EPP-1-2015-1-ES-EPPKA2-CBHE-JP); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9409047","Deep people analytics;employee attrition;retention;prediction;interpretation;policies recommendation","Big Data;Organizations;Radio frequency;Predictive models;Support vector machines;Data models;Analytical models","Big Data;data analysis;data mining;human factors;human resource management;learning (artificial intelligence);organisational aspects;personnel;statistical analysis","deep data context;data quality;deep data-driven approach;relevant employee attrition model;key employee features;feature selection algorithms;attrition prediction approach;ensemble learning models;medium-sized simulated human resources datasets;employees;employee attrition prediction;data science;big data analytics;organizations;human resources managers;attracting retaining talent;big risk;people analytics approach","","15","","40","CCBY","20 Apr 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, the short-term methodology has one critical limitation, which conflicts with the real mechanism of our visual system — a typical long-term methodology. As a result, failure cases keep showing up in the results of the current SOTA models, and the short-term methodology becomes the major technical bottleneck. To solve this problem, this paper proposes a novel VSOD approach, which performs VSOD in a complete long-term way. Our approach converts the sequential VSOD, a sequential task, to a data mining problem, i.e., decomposing the input video sequence to object proposals in advance and then mining salient object proposals as much as possible in an easy-to-hard way. Since all object proposals are simultaneously available, the proposed approach is a complete long-term approach, which can alleviate some difficulties rooted in conventional short-term approaches. In addition, we devised an online updating scheme that can grasp the most representative and trustworthy pattern profile of the salient objects, outputting framewise saliency maps with rich details and smoothing both spatially and temporally. The proposed approach outperforms almost all SOTA models on five widely used benchmark datasets.","1558-2205","","10.1109/TCSVT.2022.3185252","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62172246,62132006); Open Project Program of State Key Laboratory of Virtual Reality Technology and Systems(grant numbers:VRLAB2021A05); Youth Innovation and Technology Support Plan of Colleges and Universities in Shandong Province(grant numbers:2021KJ062); Jiangxi Provincial Science Foundation(grant numbers:20202ACB202007); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9804352","Long-term information;video salient object detection","Proposals;Task analysis;Spatiotemporal phenomena;Object detection;Biological system modeling;Motion segmentation;Data mining","data mining;image colour analysis;image fusion;image sequences;object detection;video signal processing","current consecutive limited frames;current SOTA models;data mining problem;existing state-of-the-art video salient object detection models;input video sequence;long-term approach;long-term methodology;long-term way;novel long-term iterative mining scheme;novel VSOD approach;salient object proposals;salient objects;sequential VSOD;short-term approaches;short-term methodology;spatial saliency fusion;temporal saliency fusion","","4","","88","IEEE","22 Jun 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A few of them focus on the hyperspectral EE task itself, which is a sparse large-scale problem with constraint. To fill the gap, in this article, a global-to-local EA (GL-EA) is proposed, where the global and local search is performed sequentially to extract the endmembers effectively. Specifically, in the first global search stage, two complementary solution generation strategies, including asymmetric flip-based solution generation and spectral angle distance (SAD)-based solution repair, are designed, with which the sparse large-scale search space of hyperspectral EE is fully explored and the endmembers that satisfy the constraint could be achieved. Then, in the second stage, a perturbation-based local search is suggested, which further enhances the quality of the obtained endmembers. In addition, an endmember repetition-based solution selection strategy is also developed for both global and local search stages, by using which good solutions can be selected effectively during the evolution. Experimental results on different hyperspectral datasets demonstrate that when compared with the state-of-the-art EE algorithms, the proposed GL-EA could extract the endmembers with higher quality.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2023.3242364","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62076001,62106002,61976001,61874156); Natural Science Foundation of Anhui Province(grant numbers:2008085QF309,1908085MF218,2108085MF193); Key Program of Natural Science Project of Educational Commission of Anhui Province(grant numbers:KJ2021A0048,2022AH050088); University Synergy Innovation Program of Anhui Province(grant numbers:GXXT-2020-050,GXXT-2022-034); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10036465","Endmember extraction (EE);evolutionary algorithm (EA);global-to-local search;hyperspectral image (HSI);multiobjective optimization","Optimization;Hyperspectral imaging;Search problems;Task analysis;Sparse matrices;Indexes;Data mining","evolutionary computation;feature extraction;geophysical image processing;hyperspectral imaging;search problems","endmember repetition-based solution selection strategy;evolutionary algorithms;GL-EA;hyperspectral EE task;hyperspectral endmember extraction task;large-scale search space;local evolutionary algorithm;perturbation-based local search;SAD;sparse large-scale problem;spectral angle distance-based solution repair","","","","61","IEEE","3 Feb 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Separability-based NMF is mainly handled by two types of approaches, namely, greedy pursuit and convex programming. A notable convex NMF formulation is the so-called self-dictionary multiple measurement vectors (SD-MMV), which can work without knowing the matrix rank a priori, and is arguably more resilient to error propagation relative to greedy pursuit. However, convex SD-MMV renders a large memory cost that scales quadratically with the problem size. This memory challenge has been around for a decade, and a major obstacle for applying convex SD-MMV to big data analytics. This work proposes a memory-efficient algorithm for convex SD-MMV. Our algorithm capitalizes on the special update rules of a classic algorithm from the 1950s, namely, the Frank-Wolfe (FW) algorithm. It is shown that, under reasonable conditions, the FW algorithm solves the noisy SD-MMV problem with a memory cost that grows linearly with the amount of data. To handle noisier scenarios, a smoothed group sparsity regularizer is proposed to improve robustness while maintaining the low memory footprint with guarantees. The proposed approach presents the first linear memory complexity algorithmic framework for convex SD-MMV based NMF. The method is tested over a couple of unsupervised learning tasks, i.e., text mining and community detection, to showcase its effectiveness and memory efficiency.","1941-0476","","10.1109/TSP.2022.3177845","Army Research Office(grant numbers:ARO W911NF19-1-0407); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9782542","Unsupervised multimodal analysis;sample complexity;identifiability","Signal processing algorithms;Noise measurement;Task analysis;Costs;Convex functions;Noise robustness;Hyperspectral imaging","computational complexity;convex programming;data analysis;data mining;greedy algorithms;matrix decomposition;text analysis;unsupervised learning;vectors","community detection;text mining;unsupervised learning tasks;convex SD-MMV based NMF;smoothed group sparsity regularizer;multiple measurement vector;convex NMF formulation;tractable algorithm design;Frank-Wolfe approach;self-dictionary separable nonnegative matrix factorization;memory-efficient convex optimization;linear memory complexity algorithmic framework;noisy SD-MMV problem;Frank-Wolfe algorithm;memory cost;convex programming;greedy pursuit;separability-based NMF","","2","","55","IEEE","26 May 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this article, we propose a feature fusion hypergraph neural network (F2HNN) for HSI classification. F2HNN first generates hyperedges from features of different modalities to construct a hypergraph representing multimodal features in HSI. Then, the HSI and the extracted hypergraph are input into the hypergraph convolutional neural network for learning. In addition, we propose three feature fusion strategies. The first strategy is the most basic spatial and spectral feature fusion. The second strategy fuses the spectral features extracted by a pretrained multilayer perceptron (MLP) with the spatial features to reduce the redundant information of the original spectral features. The third strategy uses the fusion of CNN features, spectral features, and spatial features to explore the capabilities of F2HNN. Sufficient experiments on four datasets have proved the effectiveness of F2HNN.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2021.3123423","National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2019YFC1510905); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9590574","Deep learning;feature fusion;graph convolution networks (GCNs);hypergraph learning;hyperspectral image (HSI) classification","Feature extraction;Convolution;Task analysis;Deep learning;Convolutional neural networks;Hyperspectral imaging;Data mining","feature extraction;geophysical image processing;graph theory;hyperspectral imaging;image classification;image fusion;learning (artificial intelligence);multilayer perceptrons;neural nets","2 HNN;hyperspectral image classification;feature fusion hypergraph convolution neural network;convolution neural networks;representation learning;convolutional neural networks;HSI classification problem;existing graph convolution network-based methods;single modal feature;mature CNN method;feature fusion hypergraph neural network;multimodal features;extracted hypergraph;hypergraph convolutional neural network;fusion strategies;spectral feature fusion;spatial features;original spectral features;CNN features","","2","","49","IEEE","27 Oct 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, the currently intelligent video surveillance is difficult to respond in real-time due to the latency of cloud computing. In this paper, a cloud-edge cooperation framework is proposed, which integrates cloud computing and edge computing in a coordinated manner. The cloud computing is used to process non-real-time and global tasks, while the edge computing is responsible for handling local monitoring video in real-time. In order to realize cloud-edge data interaction and online optimization for edge models, the heterogeneous converged network is built. In addition, an object detection model FL-YOLO composed of depthwise separable convolution and down-sampling inverted residual block is proposed, which realizes real-time video analysis at the edge. Finally, this paper discusses the complexity of FL-YOLO by its computational cost and model size. The experiment results show that the model size of FL-YOLO is 16.1MB, which is very light, and it achieves 36.7 FPS on NVIDIA Jetson TX1 and an AP of 76.7% on Multi-scene pedestrian dataset. Comparing with mainstream object detection models, FL-YOLO completes faster detection speed and higher accuracy, and it has lower calculation complexity and smaller model scale. Furthermore, the AP on Single-scene pedestrian dataset of FL-YOLO is improved to 80.7% by cloud-edge cooperation. K-Fold method is also used to further compared the performance of FL-YOLO and other models. Moreover, system test is implemented on coal mine, which validates the actual engineering effect of the proposed cloud-edge cooperation framework.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3077499","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:51874010); Key Technology Research & Innovation Team Project(grant numbers:201950ZX003); Natural Science Research Projects of Colleges and Universities in Anhui Province(grant numbers:KJ2020A0309); Huaibei Mining Group National Technology Center Project: “Coal Mine Control System Based on Video Monitoring.”; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9422766","Edge computing;YOLO;cloud-edge cooperation;real-time analysis","Cloud computing;Computational modeling;Edge computing;Coal mining;Object detection;Real-time systems;Image edge detection","cloud computing;mining industry;object detection;video signal processing;video surveillance","intelligent video surveillance;video monitoring;FL-YOLO cooperation;surveillance video real-time analysis system;coal mine;computational cost;object detection model FL-YOLO;edge models;cloud-edge data interaction;local monitoring video;nonreal-time;edge computing;cloud computing;cloud-edge cooperation framework;memory size 16.1 MByte","","15","","45","CCBY","4 May 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Current enterprises compact their business software as services into cloud platform to users. In the cloud services market, service providers attempt to make more profits from their services, while users hope to choose low-cost services with high-quality. The conflict of interests between users and service providers is an important challenge for the booming cloud service market. This article characterizes this application problem formally based on a utility game model of service providers and users. In the model, QoS is considered as the basis for determining the utilities of both parties from an economic point of view. By analyzing the behaviors of users and service providers, we introduce the concept of reputation cost for the first time in the model and find a QoS solution that balances the utilities of users and service providers in service transactions. In such a balance, any change in either party's strategy will result in a loss of utility. And then a QoS optimization method is designed to obtain a near-optimal QoS solution for a tradeoff between user satisfaction and provider profit. Extensive simulation experiments are conducted to substantiate the effectiveness of our method.

However, since the industrial process of ICPS is always complicated and large scale, the raw data only contain a few operation condition information, which brings challenges to process monitoring and control. Thus, an efficient operation condition division method for ICPS is necessary. Although many operation condition division methods have been proposed, they were mainly relying on the static characteristics and ignored how the industrial process varies dynamically. Meanwhile, with the industrial process running, there may exist some new operation conditions that make the operation condition division task even more difficult. In order to grasp the static and dynamic features simultaneously of the industrial process and divide operation conditions accurately, we proposed an operation condition division method based on joint static and dynamic analysis with incremental learning. In detail, the slow feature analysis (SFA) and self-organizing map (SOM) network were proposed to extract the static and dynamic features jointly. Then, a division strategy was proposed to distinguish the operation condition changing points. For the new operating condition, we designed an incremental learning method based on the SOM network, which can update the operation condition model in real time. Extensive experiments, including a numerical simulation, two benchmark processes, and an industrial roasting process demonstrate that the proposed method can identify the operation conditions of the raw data in ICPS accurately and efficiently.","2327-4662","","10.1109/JIOT.2021.3078330","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62073340,61860206014); National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2019YFB1705300,2019YFB1705300); Innovation-Driven Plan in Central South University, China(grant numbers:2019CX020); 111 Project, China(grant numbers:B17048); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9425548","Incremental learning;industrial cyber–physical system (ICPS);operation condition division;static and dynamic analysis","Feature extraction;Self-organizing feature maps;Internet of Things;Data mining;Process control;Indexes;Clustering methods","condition monitoring;learning (artificial intelligence);mineral processing industry;process control;process monitoring;self-organising feature maps","dynamic analysis;dynamic features;efficient operation condition division method;incremental learning method;industrial cyber-physical systems;industrial insight;industrial process;industrial roasting process;joint static analysis;operating condition;operation condition changing points;operation condition division task;operation condition information;operation condition model;operation conditions;raw data;static features","","4","","40","IEEE","7 May 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, conventional methods (such as linear programming or game theory) for the computation offloading problem cannot achieve long-term performance while the existing deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based algorithms suffer from slow convergence, lack of robustness, and unstable performance. In this article, we propose a multiagent DRL framework to achieve long-term performance for cooperative computation offloading, in which a scatter network is adopted to improve its stability and league learning is introduced for agents to explore the environment collaboratively for fast convergence and robustness. First, we study the nonorthogonal multiple access-enabled cooperative computation offloading problem and formulate the joint problem as a Markov decision process by considering both the blockchain mining tasks and data processing tasks. Second, to avoid useless exploration and unstable performance, we initially train an intelligent agent represented by scatter networks using conventional expert strategies. Third, in order to enhance the performance, we subsequently establish a hierarchical league where agents collaborate with others to explore the environment. Finally, our experimental results demonstrate that our algorithm could perform better in terms of reducing energy cost and delay cost, and shortening almost 60% of the training time compared with the state-of-the-art approaches.","2327-4662","","10.1109/JIOT.2020.3016644","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61803096,61722304,61703113,61727810); Science and Technology Plan Project of Guangzhou(grant numbers:202002030289); Key Areas of Research and Development Plan Project of Guangdong(grant numbers:2019B010147001); Major Research Project on Industry Technology of Guangzhou(grant numbers:201902020014); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9167270","Blockchain;cooperative computation offloading;deep reinforcement learning (DRL);edge computing","Internet of Things;Intelligent agents;Heuristic algorithms;Task analysis;Convergence;Training","blockchains;cloud computing;game theory;Internet of Things;learning (artificial intelligence);linear programming;Markov processes;mobile computing;multi-agent systems","fast convergence;robustness;nonorthogonal multiple access-enabled;Markov decision process;blockchain mining tasks;data processing tasks;NOMA-enabled cooperative computation offloading;league learning;stability;scatter network;multiagent DRL framework;unstable performance;deep reinforcement learning-based algorithms;computation offloading problem;linear programming;mobile-edge computing;data process tasks;blockchain verification;computation-intensive tasks;IoT;blockchain technologies;learning approach;blockchain-empowered Internet","","38","","38","IEEE","14 Aug 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, most of the current dictionary learning strategies can only be used for single-frame image separately, which are insufficient from the perspective of incremental information acquisition and global optimization for the sequential or multiframe satellite images. To this end, this article proposes an incremental dictionary learning method for multiframe satellite images representation in the spectral domain. The incremental dictionary learning is formulated analytically in the framework of sparse representation with low-rank constraint, as a frame-by-frame gradual optimization process of global and local dictionaries, and their corresponding sparse coefficients with the sequence. Specifically, the global dictionary representing the common spectral information of the sequential frames is optimized by two adjacent frames gradually. Meanwhile, the local dictionary representing the specific spectral information of each frame is optimized by the newly added frame itself. In addition, an activity ratio for separating the global dictionary from the local dictionaries, an outlier detection method for initializing the local dictionary are also given, and the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMMs) is employed to implement the above optimization. Comparison results with the related state-of-the-art methods on different datasets demonstrate that, our proposed method achieves the best representation performance in both spatial and spectral domains, and also helps to improve the performance of dictionary-based tasks using sequential satellite images, such as sea surface anomaly detection.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2022.3173936","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:41971294); China Postdoctoral Science Foundation(grant numbers:2020M680560); Cross-Media Intelligent Technology Project of Beijing National Research Center for Information Science and Technology (BNRist) of China(grant numbers:BNR2019TD01022); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9771430","Global dictionary;gradual optimization;incremental learning;local dictionary;multiframe images;sparse and low-rank constraints","Dictionaries;Machine learning;Optimization;Sparse matrices;Image representation;Satellites;Matrices","dictionaries;image classification;image motion analysis;image representation;image sequences;learning (artificial intelligence);video signal processing","global dictionary;common spectral information;sequential frames;local dictionary;specific spectral information;newly added frame;representation performance;dictionary-based tasks;sequential satellite images;multiframe satellite image representation;current dictionary learning strategies;single-frame image;incremental information acquisition;global optimization;incremental dictionary learning method;multiframe satellite images representation;sparse representation;frame-by-frame gradual optimization process","","1","","75","IEEE","10 May 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Incompleteness in data raises many issues such as compromise on transitivity property and the threat of cyclic dominance to occur within database. To overcome such issues this paper proposes an efficient algorithm called Cloud-based Incomplete Data Skyline algorithm (CIDS) for processing skyline queries over partially complete databases in cloud environment. The algorithm retrieves superior tuples with the aim of reducing domination tests between the tuples, decreasing processing time and reducing the huge amount of data flow from one data center to another.

Typically, cyber–physical environments consist of a number of mobile devices that are potentially able to establish opportunistic contacts and serve mobile applications in a cost-effective way. Opportunistic mobile service computing is a promising paradigm capable of utilizing the pervasive mobile computational resources around the users. Mobile users are thus allowed to exploit nearby mobile services to boost their computing capabilities without investment in their resource pool. Nevertheless, various challenges, especially its quality-of-service and reliability-aware scheduling, are yet to be addressed. Existing studies and related scheduling strategies consider mobile users to be fully stable and available. In this article, we propose a novel method for reliability-aware and deadline-constrained service composition over opportunistic networks. We leverage the Krill–Herd-based algorithm to yield a deadline-constrained, reliability-aware, and well-executable service composition schedule based on the estimation of completion time and reliability of schedule candidates. We carry out extensive case studies based on some well-known mobile service composition templates and a real-world opportunistic contact data set. The comparison results suggest that the proposed approach outperforms existing ones in terms of success rate and completion time of composed services. Note to Practitioners—Recently, the rapid development of mobile devices and mobile communication leads to the prosperity of mobile service computing. Services running on mobile devices within a limited range are allowed to be composed to coordinate through wireless communication technologies and perform complex tasks and business processes. Despite its great potential, mobile service compositions remains a challenge since the mobility of users and devices imposes high unpredictability on the execution of tasks. A careful investigation into existing methods has found their various limitations, e.g., assuming time-invariant availability of mobile services. This article presents a novel reliability-aware and deadline-constrained service composition method for mobile opportunistic networks. Instead of assuming time-invariant availability of mobile nodes, the proposed method is capable of estimating service availability at run-time and leveraging a Krill–Herd-based algorithm to yield the deadline-constrained, reliability-aware, and well-executable service composition schedules. Case studies based on well-known service composition templates and real-world data sets suggest that it outperforms traditional ones in terms of success and completion time of composed services. It can thus aid the design and optimization of composite services as well as their smooth execution in a mobile environment. It can help practitioners better manage the reliability and performance of real-world applications built upon mobile services.","1558-3783","","10.1109/TASE.2020.2993218","NSFC(grant numbers:61472051,61772493); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(grant numbers:2019CDXYJSJ0022); Natural Science Foundation of Chongqing (China)(grant numbers:cstc2019jcyjjqX0013); Universities’ Sci-tech Achievements Transformation Project of Chongqing(grant numbers:KJZH17104); Chongqing Research Program of Technology Innovation and Application(grant numbers:cstc2017rgznzdyfX0020,cstc2017zdcy-zdyf0554,cstc2017rgzn-zdyf0118); Chongqing Cultivation Program of Innovation and Entrepreneurship Demonstration Group(grant numbers:cstc2017kjrc-cxcytd0149); Chongqing Overseas Scholars Innovation Program(grant numbers:cx2017012,cx2018011); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9106793","Intelligent optimization;Krill–Herd algorithm;mobile computing;mobile opportunistic network;mobile service composition;service reliability","Reliability;Mobile computing;Device-to-device communication;Service computing;Quality of service;Optimization","mobile communication;mobile computing;optimisation;scheduling;smart phones;telecommunication computing;Web services","opportunistic mobile service computing;pervasive mobile computational resources;quality-of-service;reliability-aware scheduling;Krill-Herd-based algorithm;completion time;mobile communication;time-invariant availability;mobile opportunistic networks;mobile nodes;cyber-physical environments;business processes;deadline-constrained mobile service composition method;service composition schedule;service composition templates;wireless communication technologies;real-world opportunistic contact data set","","13","","68","IEEE","2 Jun 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Without any center variable, the new method automatically gauges the importance of local workers and accepts them by their contributions. Furthermore, we have developed an enhanced version of the method, WASGD+, by (1) implementing a designed sample order and (2) upgrading the weight evaluation function. To validate the new method, we benchmark our pipeline against several popular algorithms including the state-of-the-art deep neural network classifier training techniques (e.g., elastic averaging SGD). Comprehensive validation studies have been conducted on four classic datasets: CIFAR-100, CIFAR-10, Fashion-MNIST, and MNIST.

In Phase 1, a Delphi Study is conducted, results of reliability and other tests are the input of Phase 2. On the basis of these tests, variables have been selected for the next phase or final questionnaire. In Phase 2, through a survey of 285 responses in a R&D environment, the proposed framework is validated by conducting face, content and construct validity. The results indicated that formalization, specialization, differentiation, coordination mechanism, decentralization and authority of managers have a significant effect on the schedule management and successful execution of R&D projects; whereas, centralization and departmentalization do not correlate strongly. The results also imply that decentralized organizational structures (organic) are more preferable than centralized structures (mechanistic) for the execution of R&D projects when proposed timelines are to be met timely. The proposed framework will act as a supporting mechanism for engineering managers to deal with organizational structure and schedule management factors in a highly uncertain R&D environment where projects deviate frequently from their anticipated timeline.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3112112","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9536503","Organizational Structure;Project Success;Project Management;R&D Environment;R&D Projects;Schedule Management;The Delphi Study","Research and development;Schedules;Organizations;Uncertainty;Delays;Project management;Task analysis","forecasting theory;organisational aspects;project management;research and development;scheduling","critical dimensions;R&D environment;Delphi study;validation techniques;organizational structure;project success dimensions;schedule management factors","","","","149","CCBY","13 Sep 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Duchi et al. recently proposed a private sampling strategy to solve privacy leakage in stochastic optimization. However, this strategy leads to a degeneration in robustness, since this strategy is equal to noise injection on each gradient, which adversely affects updates of the primal variable. To address this challenge, we introduce a robust stochastic optimization under the framework of local privacy, which is called Privacy-pREserving StochasTIc Gradual lEarning (PRESTIGE). PRESTIGE bridges private updates of the primal variable (by private sampling) with gradual curriculum learning (CL). The noise injection leads to similar issue from label noise, but the robust learning process of CL can combat with label noise. Thus, PRESTIGE yields “private but robust” updates of the primal variable on the curriculum, that is, a reordered label sequence provided by CL. In theory, we reveal the convergence rate and maximum complexity of PRESTIGE. Empirical results on six datasets show that PRESTIGE achieves a good tradeoff between privacy preservation and robustness over baselines.","1558-2191","","10.1109/TKDE.2020.2963977","ARC(grant numbers:LP150100671,DP180100106,DP200101328); MOE, Singapore(grant numbers:MOE2015-T2-2-069); NUS, Singapore; ARC(grant numbers:DP180100966); HKBU Tier-1(grant numbers:HKBU CSD); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8949708","Stochastic optimization;differential privacy;robustness","Privacy;Optimization;Differential privacy;Robustness;Stochastic processes;Task analysis","data handling;data privacy;gradient methods;learning (artificial intelligence);optimisation;sampling methods;stochastic processes","private sampling strategy;privacy leakage;noise injection;robust stochastic optimization;local privacy;PRESTIGE;gradual curriculum learning;label noise;robust learning process;privacy-preservation stochastic gradual learning;large-scale sensitive data handling","","1","","58","IEEE","3 Jan 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, certain work has either turned to the end-to-end framework whose performance is limited by task conflicts or has consistently attempted to obtain more accurate bounding boxes (Bboxes). Few studies have focused on the impact of sample-specificity in person search datasets for training a fine-grain Re-ID model, and few have considered obtaining discriminative Re-ID features from Bboxes in a more efficient way. In this paper, a novel sample-enhanced and instance-sensitive (SEIE) framework is designed to boost performance. By analyzing the structure of person search framework, our method refines the two stages separately. For the detection stage, we re-design the usage of Bbox and a sample enhancement combination is proposed to further enhance the quality and quantity of Bboxes. SEC can suppress false positive detection results and randomly generate high-quality positive samples. For the Re-ID stage, we contribute an instance similarity loss to exploit the similarity between classless instances, and an Omni-scale Re-ID backbone is employed to learn more discriminative features. We obtain a more efficient and discriminative person search framework by concatenating the two stages.

In this paper, we proposed a feature aggregation module (FAM) to enhance the correlation between local features including spatial dependencies and channel dependencies.

FS is a preprocessing approach that has been highly fruitful in medical applications, as it not only reduces dimensionality but also allows us to understand the origins of an illness. Wrappers are computationally expensive but have excellent classification performance, whereas filters are recognized as quick techniques, although they are less accurate. This study presents an advanced binary multi-objective chimp optimization method based on the hybridization of filter and wrapper for the FS task using two archives. In exceptional instances, the initial ChOA version becomes stuck at the local optima. As a result, a novel ChOA termed EBMOChOA is developed here by integrating the Harris Hawk Optimization (HHO) into the original ChOA to improve the optimizer’s search capabilities and broaden the usage sectors. The location change step in the ChOA optimizer is separated into three parts: modifying the population using HHO to produce an HHO-based population; creating hybrid entities according to HHO-based and ChOA-based individuals; and altering the search agent in the light of greedy technique and ChOA’s tools. The effectiveness of the EBMOChOA-FW is proven by comparing it to five other well-known algorithms on nine different benchmark datasets.

It is defined as the drone scheduling problem (DSP). The effectiveness of precise algorithms and heuristic algorithms in solving DSP has been reported in previous studies. In previous studies, the speed of the vessel was assumed to be constant. However, since the influence of sea waves and vessel power, such an assumption is difficult to satisfy in actual scenarios. The actual position of the vessel may deviate from the position information obtained through prior calculations. As the cumulative position deviation increases, it is possible to make the original feasible monitoring scheme infeasible. It is necessary to consider the emission monitoring dispatching of drones under vessel speed fluctuation in actual monitoring activities of the vessel. To deal with the problem, a dynamic dispatching strategy based on reinforcement learning (RL) is proposed. Considering the vessel speed fluctuation, the monitoring window is divided into multiple sub-time windows. The route information of the vessel in each sub-time window is updated according to the vessel speed fluctuations to reduce the accumulation of deviations between the prior position and the actual position. Then, a lightweight RL strategy is adopted to quickly (re)organize the monitoring scheme in each sub-time window. Numerical experiments illustrate the above division-conquer approach could effectively reduce the possibility of drone monitoring failure caused by vessel speed fluctuations. Also, the superiority of the RL-based dispatching strategy is illustrated by comparing it with multiple dispatching schemes.","1558-0016","","10.1109/TITS.2022.3189979","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62171274,U1933125); National Natural Science Foundation of China through the Main Research Project on Machine Behavior and Human–Machine Collaborated Decision Making Methodology(grant numbers:72192820); Third Research Project on Human Behavior in Human–Machine Collaboration(grant numbers:72192822); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9852814","Drone scheduling problem;emission control area;dynamic optimization problem;reinforcement learning","Monitoring;Drones;Dispatching;Sun;Task analysis;Regulation;Sulfur","autonomous aerial vehicles;dispatching;learning (artificial intelligence);optimisation;scheduling","actual monitoring activities;actual position;cumulative position deviation;drone monitoring failure;drone scheduling problem;DSP;dynamic dispatching strategy;emission monitoring dispatching;lightweight RL strategy;original feasible monitoring scheme;port management;position information;reinforcement learning;sea waves;vessel power;vessel speed fluctuation","","2","","42","IEEE","9 Aug 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this paper, to the best of our knowledge, we initiate the first systematic investigation of data poisoning attack on the pairwise ranking algorithms, which can be generally formalized as the dynamic and static games between the ranker and the attacker, and can be modeled as certain kinds of integer programming problems mathematically. To break the computational hurdle of the underlying integer programming problems, we reformulate them into the distributionally robust optimization (DRO) problems, which are computational tractable. Based on such DRO formulations, we propose two efficient poisoning attack algorithms and establish the associated theoretical guarantees including the existence of Nash equilibrium and the generalization ability bounds. The effectiveness of the suggested poisoning attack strategies is demonstrated by a series of toy simulations and several real data experiments. These experimental results show that the proposed methods can significantly reduce the performance of the ranker in the sense that the correlation between the true ranking list and the aggregated results with toxic data can be decreased dramatically.","1939-3539","","10.1109/TPAMI.2021.3087514","National Key R&D Program of China(grant numbers:2018AAA0102003); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61931008,62025604,U1936208,61620106009,61836002,61977038,61976202,62006217); Thousand Talents Plan of Jiangxi Province(grant numbers:jxsq2019201124); Youth Innovation Promotion Association CAS; Strategic Priority Research Program of Chinese Academy of Sciences(grant numbers:XDB28000000); China Postdoctoral Science Foundation(grant numbers:2021T140653,2020M680651); Fundamental Research Funds for Central Universities; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9448491","Adversarial learning;poisoning attack;pairwise comparison;rank aggregation;robust game;distributionally robust optimization","Optimization;Heuristic algorithms;Sports;Voting;Uncertainty;Games;Data models","computer network security;decision theory;game theory;information retrieval;integer programming;learning (artificial intelligence);optimisation;sport","suggested poisoning attack strategies;data experiments;ranking list;toxic data;pairwise comparisons;sports competitions;information retrieval;strong motivation;incentives;malicious comparisons;training data;target ranking algorithm;regression;classification tasks;pairwise ranking algorithms;dynamic games;static games;underlying integer programming problems;distributionally robust optimization problems;efficient poisoning attack algorithms","Algorithms","3","","79","IEEE","8 Jun 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Due to the lack of big training data, the efforts of existing metrics in optimizing CNN-based NR-IQA models remain limited. Furthermore, the diversity of distortions in images result in the generalization problem of NR-IQA models when trained with known distortions and tested on unseen distortions, which is an easy task for human. Hence, we propose a NR-IQA metric via deep meta-learning, which is highly generalizable in the face of unseen distortions. The fundamental idea is to learn the meta-knowledge shared by human when evaluating the quality of images with diversified distortions. Specifically, we define NR-IQA of different distortions as a series of tasks and propose a task selection strategy to build two task sets, which are characterized by synthetic to synthetic and synthetic to authentic distortions, respectively. Based on these two task sets, an optimization-based meta-learning is proposed to learn the generalized NR-IQA model, which can be directly used to evaluate the quality of images with unseen distortions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our NR-IQA metric outperforms the state-of-the-arts in terms of both evaluation performance and generalization ability.","1558-2205","","10.1109/TCSVT.2021.3073410","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61771473,61991451,61379143); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(grant numbers:JBF2119,2021QN1071); Key Project of Shaanxi Provincial Department of Education(grant numbers:20JY024); Science and Technology Plan of Xi’an(grant numbers:20191122015KYPT011JC013); Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province(grant numbers:BK20181354,BK20200649); Six Talent Peaks High-level Talents in Jiangsu Province(grant numbers:XYDXX-063); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9405680","No-reference image quality assessment;generalization ability;optimization-based meta-learning;convolutional neural networks","Distortion;Measurement;Task analysis;Image quality;Adaptation models;Data models;Training","convolutional neural nets;deep learning (artificial intelligence);distortion;feature extraction;image processing;natural scenes;optimisation","task selection strategy;task sets;authentic distortions;optimization-based meta-learning;generalized NR-IQA model;unseen distortions;NR-IQA metric outperforms;no-reference image quality assessment;deep meta-learning;convolutional neural networks;big training data;CNN-based NR-IQA models;meta-knowledge;diversified distortions","","14","","60","IEEE","15 Apr 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

These built classes help decision-makers efficiently control the inventory and optimize the whole supply chain. However, existing ABC classification methods work as black-box processes that produce ABC classes without providing any explanations behind the assignment of the items. Given the multi-criteria nature of the ABC classification problem, managers cannot easily analyze and interpret the item managerial classes. Another problem of existing methods is their inability to follow the Pareto principle which states that items must be Pareto distributed over the ABC classes. To solve these two problems, we propose a semi-supervised explainable approach based on both semi-supervised clustering and explainable artificial intelligence. The semi-supervised technique is used to integrate an intelligent initialization and a constrained clustering process that guides the classification process to lead to Pareto distributed items, whereas explainable artificial intelligence is used to build detailed micro and macro explanations of the inventory classes at the item and the class levels. Application of the proposed approach for the automatic classification of chemical products of a distribution company has shown the effectiveness of the proposed approach in providing accurate, transparent, and well-explained ABC classes.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3272403","University of Jeddah, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia(grant numbers:UJ-21-ICL-3); NSF-EPSCoR-RII Track-1: Kentucky Advanced Manufacturing Partnership for Enhanced Robotics and Structures(grant numbers:IIP-1849213); NSF(grant numbers:DRL-2026584); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10114405","ABC classification;inventory classification;eXplainble Artificial Intelligence (XAI);explainable clustering;SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP);constrained clustering;semi-supervised clustering","Artificial intelligence;Buildings;Classification algorithms;Task analysis;Mathematical models;Decision making;Costs","artificial intelligence;decision making;image classification;inventory management;Pareto distribution;pattern classification;pattern clustering","ABC classes;ABC classification problem;automatic classification;automatic organization;black-box processes;built classes help decision-makers;class levels;classification process;constrained clustering process;different managerial levels;existing ABC classification methods;explainable artificial intelligence;interpretable multicriteria ABC analysis;inventory classes;inventory items;item managerial classes;multicriteria ABC classification;multicriteria nature;Pareto distributed items;rapid organization;semisupervised clustering;semisupervised explainable approach;semisupervised technique","","","","50","CCBYNCND","2 May 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, while reorganizing tasks for newer employees, it should be ensured that the employees have the requisite capabilities of handling the assigned tasks. Furthermore, security constraints forbid any arbitrary assignment of tasks to employees and also enforce major dependencies on other employees who have access to the same tasks. Since Attribute Based Access Control (ABAC) is poised to emerge as the de facto model for specifying access control policies in commercial information systems, we consider organizational policies and constraints to be modeled with ABAC. Given the increasing size and scale of organizations, both in terms of employees and resources that need to be managed, it is crucial that computational solutions are developed to automate the process of employee to task assignment. In this work, we define the Employee Replacement Problem (ERP) which answers the question of whether a given set of employees can be replaced by a smaller set of employees, while ensuring that the desired security constraints are not violated. We prove that the problem is NP-hard and use CNF-SAT to obtain a solution.

At each step, we determine which moment is the best one for the search based on a heuristic indicator. Then, at that moment, locations are searched one by one in descending order of predicted appearing probabilities until a search hit is obtained. We iterate this step until we derive the object's current location. Five searching strategies are compared via experiments.

A vehicle is usually subjected to harsh temperature conditions from its operating environment. The increasing power density of IC chips in the ECS further exacerbates the operating temperature and thermal gradient condition on the chip, thereby significantly impacting the vehicle’s reliability. In this paper, we study how to map a periodic distributed automotive application on a heterogeneous multiple-core processing architecture with temperature and system-level reliability issues in check. We first present a mathematical programming model to bound the peak operating temperature for the ECS. Then we propose a more sophisticated approach based on the genetic algorithm to effectively bound the peak temperature and optimize the system-wide reliability of the ECS by maximizing its mean-time-to-failure (MTTF). To this end, we present an algorithm to guarantee the peak temperature for periodic applications with variable execution times to ensure our approach’s effectiveness.

To explore the WD’s performance limit in terms of achievable computation rate, an optimization problem is formulated by jointly optimizing the time assignment, the power allocation, and the computation frequency under multiple system constraints. Since the problem is nonconvex with no known solution, an efficient solution approach is designed to achieve the  $\epsilon $ -optimal solution, in which the transmit power vector and the computation frequency are jointly optimized with fixed-time assignment, and then, a golden section search (GSS)-based algorithm is designed to find the optimal time assignment. For the case when the FS is with sufficiently strong computation capability, some semiclosed-form results are derived. Numerous results show that our proposed design achieves much higher computation rate than benchmark schemes. Moreover, with the increment of the helping FSs, the achievable computation rate increases while the increasing rate is decreased. Besides, by employing NOMA, the WD’s computation rate is also improved compared with orthogonal multiple access (OMA)-based scheme.

FaaS functions suffer from the cold start problem because of the scale to zero instances feature. In this work, we use neural Temporal Point Processes (TPPs) to model function invocations in FaaS compositions. A probability distribution over the time and class of the following invocations for a given history of invocations is predicted using these probabilistic models. The prediction can avoid cold starts by scaling functions in advance and reduce network load by optimizing the function-server assignment. In this regard, we developed a python-based tool called TppFaaS on top of OpenWhisk open-source serverless platform. TppFaaS uses the neural TPPs LogNormMix for modeling the time using a log-normal mixture distribution and TruncNorm for predicting a single value for the time. Furthermore, we built a custom trace data collector for OpenWhisk embedded into TppFaaS and created datasets for multiple FaaS compositions to train and test our models.

MUs compete for the shared spectrum and computing resources over time to achieve their distinctive goals. From the perspective of an MU, we deliberately define the age of update to capture the staleness of information from refreshing computation outcomes. Given the system dynamics, we model the interactions among MUs as a stochastic game. In the Nash equilibrium without cooperation, each MU behaves in accordance with the local system states and conjectures. We can hence transform the stochastic game into a single-agent Markov decision process. As another major contribution, we develop an online deep reinforcement learning (RL) scheme that adopts two separate double deep Q-networks to approximate the Q-factor and the post-decision Q-factor, respectively. The deep RL scheme allows each MU to optimize the behaviours with unknown dynamic statistics.

Then, we study the joint computation offloading, block storage, and resource service pricing problem as a three-stage Stackelberg game. We analyze the subgame optimization problem in each stage and propose an iterative algorithm based on backward induction to achieve the Nash equilibrium of the Stackelberg game. Furthermore, we derive the upper bound of the ergodic throughput of the cooperative scheme and the maximum number of devices connected to the network.

Most data used for learning analytics research comes from learning management systems. However, such systems were not developed to support learning programming. Therefore, educators have to resort to other systems that support the programming process, which can pose a challenge when it comes to understanding students’ learning since it takes place in different contexts. Methods that support the combination of different data sources are needed. Such methods would ideally account for the time-ordered sequence of students’ learning actions. In this article, we use a novel method (multi-channel sequence mining with Hidden Markov Models, HMMs) that allows the combination of multiple data sources, accounts for the temporal nature of students’ learning actions, and maps the transitions between different learning tactics. Our study included 291 students enrolled in a higher education programming course. Students’ trace-log data were collected from the learning management system and from a programming automated assessment tool. Data were analyzed using multi-channel sequence mining and HMM. The results reveal different patterns of students’ approaches to learning programming. High achievers start earlier to work on the programming assignments, use more independent strategies and consume learning resources more frequently, while the low achievers procrastinate early in the course and rely on help forums. Our findings demonstrate the potentials of multi-channel sequence mining and how this method can be analyzed using HMM. Furthermore, the results obtained can be of use for educators to understand students’ strategies when learning programming.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3134844","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9646931","Learning analytics;programming;computer science education;sequence mining;Hidden Markov Models;automated assessment","Programming profession;Data mining;Soft sensors;Trajectory;Hidden Markov models;Education;Task analysis","computer aided instruction;computer science education;data mining;educational courses;further education;hidden Markov models;teaching","multiple data sources;different learning tactics;higher education programming course;learning management system;programming automated assessment tool;multichannel sequence mining;programming assignments;complex multichannel data;learning analytics study;programming education;learning analytics research;management systems;support learning programming;programming process;understanding students","","8","","47","CCBY","10 Dec 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this paper, we present a two-stage ALPR framework to achieve efficient LP detection and recognition in unconstrained scenarios. Our LP detector is based on improved Yolov3-tiny, and we also propose a lightweight recognition network MRNet based on multi-scale features. In order to improve the inference speed, we abandoned the rectification of LP images, and RNNs that are difficult to compute in parallel. Additionally, we also propose a license plate data augmentation method, which achieves more effective augmentation and improves the generalization ability of the network through secondary random and hyperparametric search. As an additional contribution, we provide a challenging dataset collected from real-world driving recorders. The dataset is for multiple LPs in a single image, which makes up for the lack of public datasets in multiple LP scenarios. We evaluated the results on five datasets and showed that we achieved the best performance on almost all test sets, achieving 99.8% accuracy on CCPD with more than 180,000 license plate test sets.

However, standard Predictive Maintenance approaches assume the availability of sensor measurements, and the costs associated with adding sensors or remotely accessing sensor readings may discourage the development of such technologies. In this context, Alarm Forecasting can be very useful as it represents a low-cost alternative or helpful support to sensor-based Predictive Maintenance. In this work, we propose a new formulation for the Alarm Forecasting problem, framed as a multi-label classification task. We present a novel deep learning-based approach called FORMULA (alarm FORecasting in MUlti-LAbel setting). FORMULA leverages Transformer, a popular Neural Network architecture in the field of Natural Language Processing. To cope with alarm imbalance, we draw inspiration from Segmentation and Object Detection. Thus, FORMULA is trained by minimizing the Weighted Focal Loss, which turns out to be very effective in predicting rare alarms. These alarms, even if they are difficult to predict by nature, often are business-critical. We assess the proposed approach on a representative real-world problem from the packaging industry. In particular, we show that it outperforms not only classic multilabel techniques but also models based on recurrent neural networks. As regards the latter, the proposed approach also exhibits a lower computational burden, both in terms of training time and model size. To foster research in the field and reproducibility, we also publicly share the alarm logs dataset and the code used to perform the experiments. Note to Practitioners—This paper was motivated by the problem of monitoring equipment in the scenario of dairy products packaging, under the mild assumption that logs of the alarm generated by the packaging machines are available. This paper proposes an alarm forecasting algorithm. Its goal is to predict if any alarm will occur in the future, based only on past alarm logs. The limits of the considered future window can be defined arbitrarily, so there is enough time to perform corrective actions. Thus, the proposed approach aims to prevent unexpected downtime that would not only hinder productivity but also imply significant material waste. The proposed approach leverages methodologies from Natural Language Processing and Object Detection to deal with rare alarms that are often very informative in the industrial scenario. Besides, both the code and the real-world industrial datasets used to evaluate the methodology are available publicly. Currently, the proposed approach only uses alarm logs. Especially in the context of Industry 4.0, where many sensory data may be available, this is a limitation. Thus, the described approach might be extended by integrating alarm logs with sensory data. This integration is expected to improve the estimation of equipment health state. The results described in this paper may find application not only in the manufacturing sector but also in different areas such as Cyber Security, where log files keep activity records of each process performed.","1558-3783","","10.1109/TASE.2021.3127995","Regione Veneto Project VIrtualization and Remotization for Resilient and Efficient Manufacturing, Virtualizzazione e remotizzazione per una manifattura efficiente e resiliente (VIR2EM); Italian Minister for Education (MIUR) through the initiative “Departments of Excellence” (Law 232/2016); Statwolf Data Science; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9627935","Alarm forecasting;deep learning;imbalanced classification;industrial IoT;Industry 40;multi-label classification;predictive maintenance","Forecasting;Predictive models;Codes;Monitoring;Deep learning;Task analysis;Predictive maintenance","condition monitoring;data mining;learning (artificial intelligence);maintenance engineering;natural language processing;neural nets;object detection;pattern classification;production engineering computing;recurrent neural nets","rare alarms predictions;Predictive Maintenance technologies;Industrial Equipment producers;customized maintenance plans;standard Predictive Maintenance approaches;sensor measurements;adding sensors;sensor readings;Alarm Forecasting problem;multilabel classification task;deep learning-based approach;MUltiLAbel setting;FORMULA leverages Transformer;popular Neural Network architecture;Natural Language Processing;alarm imbalance;packaging industry;alarm logs;alarm forecasting algorithm;approach leverages methodologies;real-world industrial datasets","","1","","45","IEEE","29 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The aspiration point is formed by objective values which the DM wants to achieve, while the reservation point is constituted by values for the objectives not to be worsened. Internally, the first generations are performed in order to generate an initial approximation set according to the reservation point. Next, in the remaining generations, the algorithm adapts the search for new non-dominated solutions depending on the dominance relation between the solutions obtained so far and both the reservation and aspiration points. This allows knowing if the given points are achievable or not; this type of information cannot be known before the solution process starts. On this basis, the algorithm proceeds according to three different scenarios with the aim of re-orienting the search directions towards the ROI formed by the Pareto optimal solutions with objective values within the given aspiration and reservation values.

Deep learning has recently emerged as effective methods for machine FDD applications. However, the gradient descent optimization method that is commonly used in deep learning suffers from several limitations, such as high computational cost and local sub-optimal solutions. Accordingly, this paper proposes a new parallel ensemble model comprising hybrid machine and deep learning for undertaking FDD tasks. Composed of three levels of learning, the proposed ensemble model employs two base learners and a meta-learner, and is executed in parallel processing platform to achieve efficient computation. The base learners adopt a hybrid Back-Propagation (BP) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithms to exploit the corresponding local and global optimization capabilities for identifying optimal features and improving FDD performance. The proposed model is validated through a series of experiments using two benchmark data sets, i.e., CWRU and MAFaulD. The results demonstrate a high performance with accuracy rates of 98.45% and 99.79% for CWRU and MAFaulD, respectively. Its parallel implementation is able to reduce the computation time, resulting in a speed-up of 5.9 time and 7.17 time, respectively.

Due to the sheer number of involved participants, it is crucial to protect the dataflow integrity in the pipeline. While previous studies have outlined solutions to this matter, the solution for an untrusted data pipeline is still left unexplored, which motivates us to propose SIGNORA. Our proposal combines the concept of a chain of signatures with blockchain receipt to provide dataflow integrity. The chain of signatures provides a non-repudiation guarantee from participants, while the hash of the data and signatures is anchored in the blockchain for a non-tampering guarantee through blockchain receipt. Aside from that, SIGNORA also satisfies essential requirements of running data pipeline processing in an open and untrusted environment, such as (i) providing reliable identity management, (ii) solving the trust and accountability issues through a reputation system, (iii) supporting various devices through multiple cryptographic algorithms (i.e., ECDSA, EdDSA, RSA, and HMAC), and (iv) off-chain processing. Our experiment results show that SIGNORA can provide dataflow integrity provisioning in multiple scenarios of data payload size with reasonable overhead. Furthermore, the cost of smart contract methods has also been analyzed, and several off-chain solutions have been addressed to reduce transaction costs. Finally, the reputation system can adapt to the history of nodes’ activities by increasing their scores when they actively perform honest behavior while reducing their scores when they become inactive. Therefore, SIGNORA can provide a high degree of accountability for participants collaborating in an untrusted environment.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3199878","Institute for Information and Communications Technology Planning and Evaluation (IITP) Grant through the Korea Government [Ministry of Science and ICT (MSIT)], Convergence security core talent training business (Pusan National University)(grant numbers:2022-0-01201); Human Resources Development Program of the Korea Institute of Energy Technology Evaluation and Planning (KETEP) Grant through the Korea Government Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy(grant numbers:20184030202060); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9861623","Dataflow integrity;blockchain;chain of signatures;blockchain receipt;data pipeline","Blockchains;Data processing;Cloud computing;Pipeline processing;Receivers;Behavioral sciences;Smart contracts;Data flow computing","blockchains;digital signatures;pipeline processing;public key cryptography","SIGNORA;blockchain-based framework;dataflow integrity provisioning;untrusted data pipeline;processed data;blockchain receipt;nonrepudiation guarantee;data pipeline processing;open environment;untrusted environment;off-chain processing;data payload size;off-chain solutions;reputation system;cryptographic algorithms","","","","33","CCBY","18 Aug 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Because of the high-dimensional datasets and the rapid growth of data volume, a lot of challenges have been encountered in various fields such as data mining and data science. Conventional machine learning classifiers are of limited ability to handle the problems of high dimensionality that includes memory limitation, computational cost, and low accuracy performance. Consequently, there is a need to reduce the dimension of datasets by choosing the most significant features that would represent the data efficiently with minimum volume. This study proposes an improved binary version of the equilibrium optimizer algorithm (IBEO) to mitigate features selection problem. Two main enhancements are added to the original equilibrium optimizer (EO) to strengthen its performance. Opposition based learning is the first advancement added to the initialization stage of EO to enhance the diversity of the population in the search space. Local search algorithm is the second advancement added to enhance the exploitation of EO. Wrapper approaches can offer premium solutions. Thus, we used k-nearest neighbour classifier and support vector machine classifiers as the most popular wrapper methods. Moreover, dealing with the problem of over-fitting is an essential task that urges on applying k-fold cross-validation to split each dataset into training and testing data. Comparative tests with different well-known algorithms such as grey wolf optimization, grasshopper optimization, particle swarm optimization, whale optimization, dragonfly, and improved salp swarm algorithms are considered. The proposed algorithm is applied to the most commonly datasets used in the field to validate the performance. Statistical analysis studies demonstrate the effectiveness of the IBEO.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3108097","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9523539","Equilibrium optimizer (EO);feature selection;optimization;machine learning (ML);opposition based learning (OBL);classification","Feature extraction;Genetic algorithms;Convergence;Support vector machines;Transfer functions;Search problems;Particle swarm optimization","data mining;feature extraction;feature selection;learning (artificial intelligence);particle swarm optimisation;pattern classification;search problems;statistical analysis;support vector machines","high-dimensional datasets;data volume;data mining;memory limitation;computational cost;low accuracy performance;minimum volume;improved binary version;IBEO;features selection problem;EO;initialization stage;search space;local search algorithm;wrapper approaches;neighbour classifier;support vector machine classifiers;k-fold cross-validation;testing data;grey wolf optimization;grasshopper optimization;particle swarm optimization;whale optimization;salp swarm algorithms;commonly datasets;statistical analysis studies;improved equilibrium optimizer algorithm;digital devices;data representation","","12","","88","CCBY","26 Aug 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Moreover, IoT applications are emerging in diverse verticals such as connected cars, connected factories, and smart agriculture. For new business models, in order to meet key network performance indicators, connectivity must be flexible and agile. An integrated satellite-aerial-terrestrial network (I-SAT) has recently stimulated interest in providing wireless communication due to its high maneuverability, versatile deployment, and pervasive connectivity. The resource planning, task distribution, and action management of an I-SAT can be accomplished through effective acquisition, coordination, transmission, and aggregation of diverse information. This paper considers an I-SAT network, in which multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) with aerial stations and a terrestrial base station (BS), in a cognitive setting, in the presence of satellite-receiver communication, are deployed to support smart vehicles on the ground. By taking into account different limitations and Quality of Service (QoS) constraints, the goal is to maximize the average throughput among users by jointly optimizing user association, BS/UAV transmission power, and UAV trajectory. The formulated problem is a non-convex optimization problem with a complicated expression that is hard to solve. To tackle this problem, an alternating iterative algorithm based on the block descent method is proposed. Precisely, the problem is subdivided into three subproblems, transmitter-vehicle association optimization, BS/UAV power allocation optimization, and UAV trajectory control. Then, in an iterative process, these subproblems are solved sequentially. The proposed solution uses a segment-by-segment technique, which breaks the complete UAV flight trajectory into smaller time segments to reduce computation time when the network service period is considerable. As a result, each time segment’s optimization can be solved more quickly. Furthermore, the paper presents the results of network simulations carried out to assess the efficiency of the proposed solution. The findings show that the presented scheme outperforms different benchmark schemes in terms of the average user throughput when observing multiple different scenarios.","1558-2248","","10.1109/TWC.2021.3120264","Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)(grant numbers:RGPIN-2020-04678); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9583851","Integrated networks;unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs);satellite communications;cognitive radio (CR);throughput maximization;user association;power optimization;trajectory control","Trajectory;Internet of Things;Satellites;Throughput;Satellite broadcasting;Resource management;Optimization","aircraft communication;artificial satellites;autonomous aerial vehicles;cellular radio;concave programming;control engineering computing;convex programming;Internet of Things;iterative methods;quality of service;radio links;remotely operated vehicles;resource allocation;trajectory control","joint user association;power optimization;integrated satellite-aerial-terrestrial network;connected devices;IoT applications;connected cars;connected factories;network performance indicators;pervasive connectivity;I-SAT network;multiple unmanned aerial vehicles;aerial stations;terrestrial base station;satellite-receiver communication;smart vehicles;nonconvex optimization problem;transmitter-vehicle association optimization;UAV trajectory control;complete UAV flight trajectory;network service period;time segment;network simulations","","8","","36","IEEE","21 Oct 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This necessitates multiple reworks of the development task, causing delays. Therefore, it is necessary to analyze the impact of requirement change on the progress of product development. First, the development task is divided into three phases: concept development, detail design, and pilot production. Reworks that are a result of development error or changes in information are analyzed along with the reworks caused by requirement changes, which are the focus of analysis. Then, development task activities and relationships are quantitatively described, and a simulation model is built based on the system dynamics method.

Existing truth discovery methods attempt to infer the true attribute values for the entities by identifying and trusting reliable data sources. That is, the values provided by reliable sources are more likely to be the true values. However, all these methods neglect the relations among different entities, which play important roles in truth discovery task. When reliable data sources cannot provide sufficient information of entities, the true attribute values of these entities can still be inferred by propagating trustworthy information from related entities. Motivated by this, in this paper, we introduce the constrained truth discovery problem. We incorporate denial constraints, a universally quantified first-order logic formalism which can express a large number of effective and widely existing relations among entities, into the process of truth discovery. We formulate it as a constrained optimization problem and analyze its hardness. To address the problem, we propose algorithms to partition the entities into disjoint groups, and generate arithmetic constraints for each disjoint group separately. Then, the true attribute values of the entities in each disjoint group are derived by minimizing the objective function under the corresponding arithmetic constraints. Experimental results on both real-world and synthetic datasets demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves good performance even with very few constraints and reliable sources.","1558-2191","","10.1109/TKDE.2020.2982393","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:U1866602,61602129,61772157); CCF-Huawei Database System Innovation Research Plan(grant numbers:DBIR2019005B); Microsoft Research Asia; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9044433","Truth discovery;denial constraints;arithmetic constraints;source weights;iterative process","Reliability;Urban areas;Remuneration;Optimization;Task analysis;Partitioning algorithms;Correlation","data mining;formal logic;graph theory;optimisation","disjoint group;attribute values;reliable sources;diversified sources;hotspot research topic;truth discovery methods attempt;reliable data sources;truth discovery task;sufficient information;trustworthy information;related entities;constrained truth discovery problem;constrained optimization problem","","7","","36","IEEE","23 Mar 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Most existing traffic speed prediction models are proposed based on the hypothesis that traffic data are complete or have rare missing values. However, such data collected in real-world scenarios are often incomplete due to various human and natural factors. Although this problem can be solved by first estimating the missing values with an imputation model and then applying a prediction model, the former potentially breaks critical latent features and further leads to the error accumulation issues. To tackle this problem, we propose a graph-based spatio-temporal autoencoder that follows an encoder-decoder structure for spatio-temporal traffic speed prediction with missing values. Specifically, we regard the imputation and prediction as two parallel tasks and train them sequentially to eliminate the negative impact of imputation on raw data for prediction and accelerate the model training process. Furthermore, we utilize graph convolutional layers with a self-adaptive adjacency matrix for spatial dependencies modeling and apply gated recurrent units for temporal learning. To evaluate the proposed model, we conduct comprehensive case studies on two real-world traffic datasets with two different missing patterns and a wide and practical missing rate range from 20% to 80%. Experimental results demonstrate that the model consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art traffic prediction with missing values methods and achieves steady performance in the investigated missing scenarios and prediction horizons.","1558-0016","","10.1109/TITS.2022.3233890","Stable Support Plan Program of Shenzhen Natural Science Fund(grant numbers:20200925155105002); General Program of Guangdong Basic and Applied Basic Research Foundation(grant numbers:2019A1515011032); Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory(grant numbers:2020B121201001); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10012030","Traffic speed prediction;missing data;spatio-temporal modeling;deep learning;multi-task learning","Task analysis;Predictive models;Training;Multitasking;Feature extraction;Deep learning;Data mining","convolutional neural nets;graph theory;intelligent transportation systems;learning (artificial intelligence);recurrent neural nets;road traffic;spatiotemporal phenomena;traffic engineering computing","critical latent features;different missing patterns;error accumulation issues;existing traffic speed prediction models;graph-based spatio-temporal autoencoder;imputation model;intelligent transportation systems;investigated missing scenarios;missing data;model training process;multitask learning approach;parallel tasks;practical missing rate range;prediction horizons;prediction model;rare missing values;raw data;real-world traffic data;real-world traffic datasets;spatio-temporal traffic speed prediction;state-of-the-art traffic prediction;temporal learning;values methods;wide rate range","","","","52","IEEE","9 Jan 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The popularity of these methods also makes them widely exposed to malicious attacks, which may cause severe security concerns. To understand the security properties of the ML/DL methods, researchers have recently started to turn their focus to adversarial attack algorithms that could successfully corrupt the model or clean data owned by the victim with imperceptible perturbations. In this paper, we study the Label Flipping Attack (LFA) problem, where the attacker expects to corrupt an ML/DL model's performance by flipping a small fraction of the labels in the training data. Prior art along this direction adopts combinatorial optimization problems, leading to limited scalability toward deep learning models. To this end, we propose a novel minimax problem which provides an efficient reformulation of the sample selection process in LFA. In the new optimization problem, the sample selection operation could be implemented with a single thresholding parameter. This leads to a novel training algorithm called Sample Thresholding. Since the objective function is differentiable and the model complexity does not depend on the sample size, we can apply Sample Thresholding to attack deep learning models. Moreover, since the victim's behavior is not predictable in a poisonous attack setting, we have to employ surrogate models to simulate the true model employed by the victim model. Seeing the problem, we provide a theoretical analysis of such a surrogate paradigm. Specifically, we show that the performance gap between the true model employed by the victim and the surrogate model is small under mild conditions. On top of this paradigm, we extend Sample Thresholding to the crowdsourced ranking task, where labels collected from the annotators are vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Finally, experimental analyses on three real-world datasets speak to the efficacy of our method.","1939-3539","","10.1109/TPAMI.2022.3220849","National Key R & D Program of China(grant numbers:2018AAA0102000); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:U21B2038,61931008,62025604,U1936208,6212200758,61976202); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities; Youth Innovation Promotion Association of the Chinese Academy of Sciences; Strategic Priority Research Program of Chinese Academy of Sciences(grant numbers:XDB28000000); China National Postdoctoral Program for Innovative Talents(grant numbers:BX2021298); China Postdoctoral Science Foundation(grant numbers:2022M713101); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9944159","Label flipping attack;machine learning","Data models;Training data;Training;Deep learning;Predictive models;Testing;Optimization","computer network security;crowdsourcing;deep learning (artificial intelligence);learning (artificial intelligence);minimax techniques;optimisation","adversarial attack algorithms;adversarial attacks;AI applications;clean data;combinatorial optimization problems;deep learning models;fundamental building blocks;Label Flipping Attack problem;LFA;malicious attacks;model complexity;novel minimax problem;optimization problem;poisonous attack setting;sample masking;sample selection operation;sample selection process;security properties;severe security concerns;single thresholding parameter;surrogate model;training algorithm calledSample Thresholding;training data;victim model","","","","59","IEEE","9 Nov 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Compared with the large-scale coverage areas for remote sensing imagery, the key objects, such as cars and ships, in HRS imagery often contain only a few pixels. In this article, to tackle this problem, the foreground activation (FA)-driven small object semantic segmentation (FactSeg) framework is proposed from perspectives of structure and optimization. In the structure design, FA object representation is proposed to enhance the awareness of the weak features in small objects. The FA object representation framework is made up of a dual-branch decoder and collaborative probability (CP) loss. In the dual-branch decoder, the FA branch is designed to activate the small object features (activation) and suppress the large-scale background, and the semantic refinement (SR) branch is designed to further distinguish small objects (refinement). The CP loss is proposed to effectively combine the activation and refinement outputs of the decoder under the CP hypothesis. During the collaboration, the weak features of the small objects are enhanced with the activation output, and the refined output can be viewed as the refinement of the binary outputs. In the optimization stage, small object mining (SOM)-based network optimization is applied to automatically select effective samples and refine the direction of the optimization while addressing the imbalanced sample problem between the small objects and the large-scale background. The experimental results obtained with two benchmark HRS imagery segmentation datasets demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms the state-of-the-art semantic segmentation methods and achieves a good tradeoff between accuracy and efficiency.

Due to a limited amount of resources at the EC compared to the back-end cloud (BC), intelligent resource management techniques become imperative. This paper studies the problem of multi-resource allocation (MRA) in terms of compute and wireless resources in an integrated EC and BC environment. Machine learning-based approaches are emerging to solve such optimization problems. However, it is challenging to adopt traditional discrete action space-based methods due to their high dimensionality issue. To this end, we propose a deep-deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) based temporal feature learning attentional network (TFLAN) model to address the MRA problem. TFLAN combines convolution, gated recurrent unit and attention layers together to mine local and long term temporal information from the task sequences for excellent function approximation. A novel heuristic-based priority experience replay (hPER) method is formulated to accelerate the convergence speed. Further, a pruning principle helps the TFLAN agent to significantly reduce the computational complexity and balance the load among base stations and servers to minimize the rejection-rate. Lastly, data parallelism technique is adopted for distributed training to meet the needs of a high-volume of IoT traffic in the EC environment. Experimental results demonstrate that the distributed training approach suites well to the problem scale and can magnify the speed of the learning process. We validate the proposed framework by comparing with five state-of-the-art RL agents. Our proposed agent converges fast and achieves up to 28% and 72% reduction in operational cost and rejection-rate, and achieves up to 32% gain in the quality of experience on average, compared to the most advanced DDPG agent.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3249153","NSF PAWR COSMOS(grant numbers:1827923); NSF IRNC COSMIC(grant numbers:2029295); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10054044","Edge cloud computing;wireless networks;deep deterministic policy gradient;resource allocation;smart city;IoT;beyond 5G;distributed training;heuristic priority experience replay","Resource management;Internet of Things;Edge computing;Costs;Computational modeling;5G mobile communication;Cloud computing;Heuristic algorithms;Wireless networks","5G mobile communication;cloud computing;computational complexity;computer network security;deep learning (artificial intelligence);function approximation;gradient methods;Internet of Things;optimisation;recurrent neural nets;resource allocation;telecommunication computing","B5G;back-end cloud;base stations;BC environment;beyond 5G wireless networks;computational complexity;data parallelism technique;DDPG;deep-deterministic policy gradient;discrete action space-based methods;distributed training approach suites;edge-cloud system;function approximation;gated recurrent unit;heuristic-based priority experience replay method;hPER;integrated EC environment;intelligent resource management techniques;Internet-of-Things;IoT traffic;local term temporal information;machine learning-based approaches;MRA problem;multiresource allocation;optimization problems;real-time traffics;temporal feature learning attentional network model;TFLAN agent;wireless resources","","","","59","CCBY","27 Feb 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Existing approaches assume that the feature space is fixed or changes by following explicit regularities, limiting their applicability in real-time applications. For example, in a smart healthcare platform, the feature space of the patient data varies when different medical service providers use nonidentical feature sets to describe the patients’ symptoms. To fill the gap, we in this article propose a novel learning paradigm, namely, Generative Learning With Streaming Capricious (GLSC) data, which does not make any assumption on the feature space dynamics. In other words, GLSC handles the data streams with a varying feature space, where each arriving data instance can arbitrarily carry new features and/or stop carrying partial old features. Specifically, GLSC trains a learner on a universal feature space that establishes relationships between old and new features, so that the patterns learned in the old feature space can be used in the new feature space. The universal feature space is constructed by leveraging the relatednesses among features. We propose a generative graphical model to model the construction process, and show that learning from the universal feature space can effectively improve the performance with theoretical guarantees. The experimental results demonstrate that GLSC achieves conspicuous performance on both synthetic and real data sets.","2162-2388","","10.1109/TNNLS.2020.2981386","National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2016YFB1000901); National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)(grant numbers:91746209); U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF)(grant numbers:IIS-1652107,IIS-1763620,CCF-1750886); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9066871","Biconvex optimization;capricious data streams;graphical model;online learning","Medical services;Task analysis;Graphical models;Learning systems;Data mining;Prediction algorithms;Training","data mining;feature extraction;graph theory;learning (artificial intelligence)","universal feature space;data streams mining;data instance;Generative Learning With Streaming Capricious data;GLSC data;generative graphical model","","12","","48","IEEE","14 Apr 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Most of the existing works transform the multiobjective problem into a single objective problem through constraints or scalarization method. However, due to the uncertain importance (weights) of objectives and the instable quality of crowdsensed data, such transformation is usually unrealizable. In this article, we aim to optimize the worst performance of two objective functions in mobile crowdsensing in order to improve the system robustness. We model an auction-based biobjective robust mobile crowdsensing system, and design two independent objective functions to maximize the expected profit and coverage, respectively. We formulate the robust user selection (RUS) problem, and design an incentive mechanism, which utilizes the combination of binary search and greedy algorithm, to solve the RUS problem. Through both rigorous theoretical analysis and extensive simulations, we demonstrate that the designed incentive mechanisms satisfy desirable properties of computational efficiency, individual rationality, truthfulness, and constant approximation to the tightened RUS problem. Moreover, the proposed incentive mechanism can be easily extended to multiobjective robust mobile crowdsensing systems, and all desirable properties still hold.

The big data era with a high volume of data generated by a variety of sources has provided enhanced opportunities for utilizing sentiment analysis in various domains. In order to take best advantage of the high volume of data for accurate sentiment analysis, it is essential to clean the data before the analysis, as irrelevant or redundant data will hinder extracting valuable information. In this paper, we propose a hybrid feature selection algorithm to improve the performance of sentiment analysis tasks. Our proposed sentiment analysis approach builds a binary classification model based on two feature selection techniques: an entropy-based metric and an evolutionary algorithm. We have performed comprehensive experiments in two different domains using a benchmark dataset, Stanford Sentiment Treebank, and a real-world dataset we have created based on World Health Organization (WHO) public speeches regarding COVID-19. The proposed feature selection model is shown to achieve significant performance improvements in both datasets, increasing classification accuracy for all utilized machine learning and text representation technique combinations. Moreover, it achieves over 70% reduction in feature size, which provides efficiency in computation time and space.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3118961","2232 International Fellowship for Outstanding Researchers Program of TÜBİTAK(grant numbers:118C309); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9564078","Binary classification;evolutionary computation;feature selection;multiobjective optimization;sentiment analysis","Feature extraction;Sentiment analysis;Task analysis;Machine learning;Analytical models;Measurement;Data mining","data mining;entropy;evolutionary computation;feature extraction;feature selection;learning (artificial intelligence);natural language processing;pattern classification;text analysis","Stanford Sentiment Treebank;feature selection model;evolutionary multiobjective feature selection;prominent research areas;data mining;knowledge discovery;public opinion;big data era;utilizing sentiment analysis;accurate sentiment analysis;irrelevant data;redundant data;hybrid feature selection algorithm;sentiment analysis tasks;sentiment analysis approach;feature selection techniques;evolutionary algorithm","","6","","71","CCBY","8 Oct 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

While seminal topic modelling techniques such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) have been proposed, the ubiquity of social media and the brevity of its texts pose unique challenges for such traditional topic modelling techniques. Several extensions including auxiliary aggregation, self aggregation and direct learning have been proposed to mitigate these challenges, however some still remain. These include a lack of consistency in the topics generated and the decline in model performance in applications involving disparate document lengths. There is a recent paradigm shift towards neural topic models, which are not suited for resource-constrained environments. This paper revisits LDA-style techniques, taking a theoretical approach to analyse the relationship between word co-occurrence and topic models. Our analysis shows that by altering the word co-occurrences within the corpus, topic discovery can be enhanced. Thus we propose a novel data transformation approach dubbed DATM to improve the topic discovery within a corpus. A rigorous empirical evaluation shows that DATM is not only powerful, but it can also be used in conjunction with existing benchmark techniques to significantly improve their effectiveness and their consistency by up to 2 fold.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3262653","Charles Sturt University publication grant; Charles Sturt University Early Career Researcher Award 2021; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10083137","Document transformation;greedy algorithm;information retrieval;latent dirichlet allocation;multi-set multi-cover problem;probabilistic generative topic modelling","Data models;Reliability;Australia;Task analysis;Social networking (online);Context modeling;Benchmark testing;Document handling","data mining;information retrieval;natural language processing;social networking (online);text analysis","auxiliary aggregation;benchmark techniques;data mining tasks;DATM;improved effectiveness;Latent Dirichlet Allocation;LDA-style techniques;neural topic models;novel data agnostic topic modeling technique;novel data transformation approach;seminal topic modelling techniques;topic discovery;traditional topic modelling techniques;word co-occurrence","","","","62","CCBYNCND","28 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A multiscale time–frequency feature map (MTFFM) and a global statistical feature matrix (GSFM) of vibration signals are first constructed using wavelet packet transform (WPT). A deep feature extraction network combining ResNet and SAM networks is then designed to realize the fused extraction of local and global time–frequency features. Finally, we construct a joint loss function by the combination of the multikernel maximum mean discrepancy (MK-MMD) and the domain adversarial neural network (DANN) to optimize the depth feature extraction network, which improves the cross-domain invariance and fault state discrimination of depth features. The proposed optimization method fully exploits the advantages of high-dimensional spatial distribution difference evaluation and gradient inversion adversarial strategy.

It is a crucial task that aids machine learning classifiers in reducing error rates, computation time, overfitting, and improving classification accuracy. It has demonstrated its efficacy in myriads of domains, ranging from its use for text classification (TC), text mining, and image recognition. While there are many traditional FS methods, recent research efforts have been devoted to applying metaheuristic algorithms as FS techniques for the TC task. However, there are few literature reviews concerning TC. Therefore, a comprehensive overview was systematically studied by exploring available studies of different metaheuristic algorithms used for FS to improve TC. This paper will contribute to the body of existing knowledge by answering four research questions (RQs): 1) What are the different approaches of FS that apply metaheuristic algorithms to improve TC? 2) Does applying metaheuristic algorithms for TC lead to better accuracy than the typical FS methods? 3) How effective are the modified, hybridized metaheuristic algorithms for text FS problems?, and 4) What are the gaps in the current studies and their future directions? These RQs led to a study of recent works on metaheuristic-based FS methods, their contributions, and limitations. Hence, a final list of thirty-seven (37) related articles was extracted and investigated to align with our RQs to generate new knowledge in the domain of study. Most of the conducted papers focused on addressing the TC in tandem with metaheuristic algorithms based on the wrapper and hybrid FS approaches.

Based on a sample of 207 Chinese manufacturing firms, we find that while servitization does not necessarily enhance customer loyalty, successful servitization implementation depends on proper combinations of IT tools and Culture. Specifically, the SSP–OIT–Culture interaction and SSC–SM–Culture interaction are positively associated with customer loyalty. Our findings not only provide evidence against the conventional intuition that customer loyalty can be achieved by adopting servitization, but also explicitly show how to enhance customer loyalty by proper organizational practices, which provide new insights into both servitization and organizational information processing theory.","1558-0040","","10.1109/TEM.2021.3052561","National Social Science Fund of China(grant numbers:15ZDB150); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:71832011,71571140); Science and Technology Innovation Team Plan of Shaanxi Province(grant numbers:2020TD-006); Hong Kong Polytechnic University; Hong Kong Polytechnic University; Fung Yiu King – Wing Hang Bank Endowed Professorship in Business Administration; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9350218","Culture;customer loyalty;information processing;information technology;servitization;social media","Information processing;Cognition;Task analysis;Manufacturing;Social networking (online);Complexity theory;Uncertainty","customer services;manufacturing industries;organisational aspects;service industries","Chinese manufacturing firms;individual service-oriented cognition;information technology tools;joint effects;organizational information processing theory;organizational IT;service-oriented corporate culture;services supporting clients;services supporting products;servitization-customer loyalty link;servitized firms;social media;SSC-SM-culture interaction;SSP-OIT-culture interaction","","2","","97","IEEE","8 Feb 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

If they are used directly, it is not only computationally expensive but also difficult to obtain satisfactory results. Unsupervised feature selection is designed to reduce the dimension of data by finding a subset of features in the absence of labels. Many unsupervised methods perform feature selection by exploring spectral analysis and manifold learning, such that the intrinsic structure of data can be preserved. However, most of these methods ignore a fact: due to the existence of noise features, the intrinsic structure directly built from original data may be unreliable. To solve this problem, a new unsupervised feature selection model is proposed. The graph structure, feature weights, and projection matrix are learned simultaneously, such that the intrinsic structure is constructed by the data that have been feature weighted and projected. For each data point, its nearest neighbors are acquired in the process of graph construction. Therefore, we call them adaptive neighbors. Besides, an additional constraint is added to the proposed model. It requires that a graph, corresponding to a similarity matrix, should contain exactly  $c$  connected components. Then, we present an optimization algorithm to solve the proposed model. Next, we discuss the method of determining the regularization parameter  $\gamma $  in our proposed method and analyze the computational complexity of the optimization algorithm. Finally, experiments are implemented on both synthetic and real-world datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.","2168-2275","","10.1109/TCYB.2021.3087632","National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2018AAA0101902); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61772427,61502521,61751202); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9505625","Adaptive neighbor;dimensionality reduction;projection;unsupervised feature selection;weighted features","Feature extraction;Optimization;Manifolds;Data mining;Computational modeling;Task analysis;Manifold learning","computational complexity;data mining;feature extraction;graph theory;learning (artificial intelligence);matrix algebra;optimisation;pattern clustering;spectral analysis;unsupervised learning","data mining;data point;feature weighted;feature weights;fundamental problem;graph structure;high-dimensional data;intrinsic structure;manifold learning;noise features;projected adaptive neighbors;projection matrix;spectral analysis;unsupervised feature selection model;unsupervised methods","","4","","39","IEEE","3 Aug 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

It extracts fine-grained sentiment information in user-generated reviews, as it aims at predicting the polarities towards predefined aspect categories or relevant entities in free text. Previous deep learning approaches usually rely on large-scale pre-trained language models and the attention mechanism, which applies the complete computed attention weights and does not place any restriction on the attention assignment. We argue that the original attention mechanism is not the ideal configuration for ABSA, as for most of the time only a small portion of terms are strongly related to the sentiment polarity of an aspect or entity. In this paper, we propose a masked attention mechanism customized for ABSA, with two different approaches to generate the mask. The first method sets an attention weight threshold that is determined by the maximum of all weights, and keeps only attention scores above the threshold. The second selects the top words with the highest weights. Both remove the lower score parts that are assumed to be less relevant to the aspect of focus. By ignoring part of input that is claimed irrelevant, a large proportion of input noise is removed, keeping the downstream model more focused and reducing calculation cost. Experiments on the Multi-Aspect Multi-Sentiment (MAMS) and SemEval-2014 datasets show significant improvements over state-of-the-art pre-trained language models with full attention, which displays the value of the masked attention mechanism. Recent work shows that simple self-attention in Transformer quickly degenerates to a rank-1 matrix, and masked attention may be another cure for that trend.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3142178","Research Innovation Team Fund from the Department of Education, Sichuan Province(grant numbers:18TD0026); Sichuan Science and Technology Program(grant numbers:2020YFG0168); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9676694","Sentiment analysis;attention mechanism;pre-trained language model;masked attention","Task analysis;Sentiment analysis;Bit error rate;Deep learning;Data mining;Transformers;Semantics","data mining;learning (artificial intelligence);natural language processing;text analysis","predefined aspect categories;relevant entities;previous deep learning;large-scale pre-trained language models;complete computed attention weights;attention assignment;original attention mechanism;ABSA;sentiment polarity;attention weight threshold;attention scores;lower score parts;MultiAspect MultiSentiment;state-of-the-art pre-trained language models;simple self-attention;unrestricted attention;need-masked attention mechanism focuses better;relevant parts;Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis;highly challenging tasks;natural language processing;fine-grained sentiment information;user-generated reviews","","7","","56","CCBY","11 Jan 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Multi-organ segmentation of clinical Computed Tomography (CT) images of the patient’s abdomen and magnetic resonance images (MRI) of the patient’s heart is a challenging task in medical image segmentation. The accurate segmentation of multiple organs is an important prerequisite for disease diagnosis and treatment planning. Methods: In this paper, we propose a new method based on multi-organ segmentation in CT images or MRI images; this method is based on the CNN-Transformer hybrid model, and on this basis, a progressive sampling module is added. Results: We performed multi-organ segmentation on CT images and MRI images provided by two public datasets, Synapse multi-organ CT dataset (Synapse) and Automated cardiac diagnosis challenge dataset (ACDC). By using Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) and Hausdorff_95 (HD95) as the evaluation metric for the Synapse dataset. For the Synapse dataset of CT images, the average DSC reached 79.76%, and the HD95 reached 21.55%. The DSC indicators of Kidney(R), Pancreas, and Stomach reached 80.77%, 59.84%, and 81.11%, respectively. The average DSC for the ACDC dataset of MRI images reaches 91.8%, far exceeding other state-of-the-art techniques. Conclusion: In this paper, we propose a multi-sampled vision transformer MPSHT based on the CNN-Transformer structure.

This has several benefits such as easier maintenance and update of services. However, deploying a microservice-based application is often more complicated than a monolithic application. While a monolithic application can be deployed one at a time on a group of similar servers behind a load balancer, a microservice-based application consists of different microservices and each microservice usually has more than one runtime instance that needs to be configured and deployed. For a small number of microservices and applications, the deployment could be done manually. However, a large number of microservices are frequently observed in practice. In such cases, the deployment becomes cumbersome and error-prone and does not scale with the increased number of services. To cope with this problem, we present a systematic approach and the corresponding tool support for enabling the deployment of microservices to resources that have limited capacity. Hereby, we model and define the design space given the deployment parameters and automatically derive the feasible deployment solution. The approach is validated using a taxi-hailing system case study inspired by Uber which has spread all over the world in recent years.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3057582","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9348889","Automated deployments for microservices;capacitated task assignment problem (CTAP);deriving feasible microservice deployments;optimization algorithms","Containers;Computer architecture;Cloud computing;Servers;Scalability;Task analysis;Tools","business data processing","microservice architectures;microservice-based application;deployment parameters;microservice deployment alternatives","","11","","49","CCBY","5 Feb 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Contextual information is essential for text classification, and different words usually need different sizes of contextual information. However, most existing methods learn contextual features with predefined fixed sizes, which cannot extract the different sizes of contextual features for different words. To this end, we propose a new model named Deformable Self-Attention (DSA) to flexibly learn word-specific contextual features, rather than extracting features of fixed context sizes. Our model is mainly composed of a Deformable Local Attention Weight Generation (DLAWG) module and a Multi-Range Feature Integration (MRFI) module. The DLAWG module can adaptively determine different context sizes for different words within a particular range and then learn word-specific contextual features for each word.

However, the mining process requires high computational power, which prevents IoT devices from directly participating in blockchain construction. For this reason, edge computing service is introduced to help build the IoT blockchain, where IoT devices could purchase computational resources from the edge servers. In this paper, we consider the case that IoT devices also have other tasks that need the help of edge servers, such as data analysis and data storage. The profits they can get from these tasks is closely related to the amounts of resources they purchased from the edge servers. In this scenario, IoT devices will allocate their limited budgets to purchase different resources from different edge servers, such that their profits can be maximized. Moreover, edge servers will set “best” prices such that they can get the biggest benefits. Accordingly, there raise a pricing and budget allocation problem between edge servers and IoT devices. We model the interaction between edge servers and IoT devices as a multi-leader multi-follower Stackelberg game, whose objective is to reach the Stackelberg Equilibrium (SE). We prove the existence and uniqueness of the SE point, and design efficient algorithms to reach the SE point. In the end, we verify our model and algorithms by performing extensive simulations, and the results show the correctness and effectiveness of our designs.","2168-7161","","10.1109/TCC.2022.3150766","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:12071478); National Science Foundation(grant numbers:1907472); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9712423","Internet of Things;blockchain;edge computing;stackelberg game","Blockchains;Internet of Things;Servers;Task analysis;Games;Security;Edge computing","blockchains;computer network security;data analysis;data mining;data privacy;edge computing;game theory;Internet of Things;pricing","budget allocation problem;different edge servers;edge computing service;IoT blockchain;IoT devices;pricing","","4","","33","IEEE","14 Feb 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To address these issues, we introduce neural architecture search (NAS) into automatically designing person reID backbones, i.e., reID-NAS, which is achieved via automatically searching attention-based network architectures from scratch. Different from traditional NAS approaches that originated for image classification, we design a reID-based search space as well as a search objective to fit NAS for the reID tasks. In terms of the search space, reID-NAS includes a lightweight attention module to precisely locate arbitrary pedestrian bounding boxes, which is automatically added as attention to the reID architectures. In terms of the search objective, reID-NAS introduces a new retrieval objective to search and train reID architectures from scratch. Finally, we propose a hybrid optimization strategy to improve the search stability in reID-NAS. In our experiments, we validate the effectiveness of different parts in reID-NAS, and show that the architecture searched by reID-NAS achieves a new state of the art, with one order of magnitude fewer parameters on three-person reID datasets. As a concomitant benefit, the reliance on the pretraining process is vastly reduced by reID-NAS, which facilitates one to directly search and train a lightweight reID model from scratch.","2162-2388","","10.1109/TNNLS.2021.3082701","National Science Fund for Distinguished Young Scholars(grant numbers:62025603); National Nature Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:U1705262,61972167,62072386,62072387,62072389,62002305,61772443,61802324,61702136); National Key Research and Development Program(grant numbers:2017YFC0113000,2016YFB1001503); Nature Science Foundation of Fujian Province, China(grant numbers:2017J01125,2018J01106); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(grant numbers:30918014108,20720200077,20720200090,20720200091); Basic and Applied Basic Research Foundation of Guangdong Province(grant numbers:2019B1515120049); Open Project Program of the National Laboratory of Pattern Recognition (NLPR)(grant numbers:202000012); Project of Guangxi Science and Technology(grant numbers:GuiKeAD21075030); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9444559","Attention;hybrid optimization;neural architecture search (NAS);person reidentification (reID);retrieval","Search problems;Task analysis;Computer architecture;Optimization;Training;Computational modeling;Feature extraction","deep learning (artificial intelligence);feature extraction;image classification;neural net architecture;search problems","attention-based network architectures;expert-designed deep neural network architectures;image classification;lightweight reID model;NAS approaches;neural architecture search;person reID backbones;person reidentification;reID architectures;reID task;reID-based search space;reID-NAS;three-person reID datasets","Humans;Biometric Identification;Neural Networks, Computer;Image Processing, Computer-Assisted;Pedestrians","2","","73","IEEE","31 May 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

It pushes the computational resources in close proximity to the data sources and thus, caters for the explosive growth of vehicular applications. Owing to the high mobility of vehicles, these applications are of latency-sensitive requirements in most cases. Accordingly, such requirements still pose a great challenge to the computing capabilities of VEC, when these applications are outsourced and executed in VEC. Against this backdrop, we propose a new mathematical model, which, respectively, generalizes the computation and communication models, and applies application-oriented caching into VEC in this article. Based on this model, a new strategy is further proposed to optimize the average response time of applications over an infinite time-slotted horizon for VEC. A long-term energy consumption constraint is imposed to guarantee the stability of the VEC system, and the Lyapunov optimization technology is adopted to tackle this constraint issue. Two greedy heuristics are put forward to help find the approximate optimal solution in the drift-plus-penalty-based algorithm. Extensive experiments have been conducted to evaluate the response time and energy consumption in the caching-assisted VEC. The simulation results have shown that the proposed strategy can dramatically optimize the average response time while satisfying the long-term energy consumption constraint.","2327-4662","","10.1109/JIOT.2021.3108902","National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2020YFB2104301); Chinese National Research Fund (NSFC) Key Project(grant numbers:61532013,61872239); Project “Network Communication Intelligent Core Chip Design and Core Software (PCL2021-A08),” and the Project “Beihang Beidou Technological Achievements Transformation and Industrialization Funds (BARI2005)”; FCT/MCTES through national funds and when applicable co-funded EU Funds(grant numbers:UIDB/50008/2020); Brazilian National Council for Research and Development (CNPq)(grant numbers:313036/2020-9); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9525145","Caching;greedy heuristics;Lyapunov optimization;service provisioning;vehicular edge computing (VEC)","Energy consumption;Time factors;Task analysis;Optimization;Outsourcing;Simulation;Servers","cache storage;distributed processing;energy consumption;greedy algorithms;minimisation;traffic engineering computing","response time minimization;caching-assisted vehicular edge computing;computational resources;latency-sensitive requirements;communication models;application-oriented caching;infinite time-slotted horizon;long-term energy consumption constraint;caching-assisted VEC system;Lyapunov optimization technology;greedy heuristics;drift-plus-penalty-based algorithm","","12","","29","IEEE","30 Aug 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, these methods often suffer the performance deterioration facing limited labeled data in real-world applications. To address this problem, a novel self-supervised semantic segmentation framework is proposed for remote sensing imageries with limited labeled data. Specifically, image inpainting is acted as pixel-level pretext task for learning dense feature representations suitable for semantic segmentation. Furthermore, rather than trivially leveraging the conventional random inpainting strategy, a novel adversarial training scheme is proposed to drive the pretext task to adaptively mask and restore salient local regions. The adversarial training scheme consists of instructor network and inpainting network, the instructor network increasingly predicts meaningful salient regions as erased regions, and meanwhile the inpainting network seeks for restoring the corrupted image as pretext task to learn its intrinsic representation. Moreover, the structural similarity (SSIM) is applied as a patch-level loss function for semantic segmentation considering that remote sensing images are highly structured. The experimental results on the International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing (ISPRS) Potsdam dataset demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art self-supervised methods and the ImageNet pre-training methods.

With this aim in mind, this paper proposes the first combination of Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) approach, Fuzzy Best-Worst Method (Fuzzy BWM), and Simulation-based Fuzzy Multi-Criteria Interactive Decision-Making method (Fuzzy TODIM). Firstly, the DEA model helps to filter out potentially and highly effective locations from feasible locations. Afterward, Fuzzy BWM is a worthy and effective alternative to Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) in weighting criteria. Finally, the simulation-based Fuzzy TODIM method evaluates potential locations, taking into account both the consideration of the criteria interaction and the decision maker’s aversion to loss. Based on the simulation results, the study finds the thresholds of the loss attenuation coefficient that change the ranking of potential locations. Last but not least, to validate the ranking result, the comparison shows that the proposed method’s results have a high degree of similarity with actual wave energy projects in Australia.

Remote sensing change detection (CD) can provide an effective approach for in-time detection and prevention of such incidents. However, existing CD methods are difficult to deal with the large intraclass differences of cropland changes in high-resolution images. In addition, traditional CNN based models are plagued by the loss of long-range context information, and the high computational complexity brought by deep layers. Therefore, in this article, we propose a CNN-transformer network with multiscale context aggregation (MSCANet), which combines the merits of CNN and transformer to fulfill efficient and effective cropland CD. In the MSCANet, a CNN-based feature extractor is first utilized to capture hierarchical features, then a transformer-based MSCA is designed to encode and aggregate context information. Finally, a multibranch prediction head with three CNN classifiers is applied to obtain change maps, to enhance the supervision for deep layers. Besides, for the lack of CD dataset with fine-grained cropland change of interest, we also provide a new cropland change detection dataset, which contains 600 pairs of 512 × 512 bi-temporal images with the spatial resolution of 0.5–2m. Comparative experiments with several CD models prove the effectiveness of the MSCANet, with the highest F1 of 64.67% on the high-resolution semantic CD dataset, and of 71.29% on CLCD.","2151-1535","","10.1109/JSTARS.2022.3177235","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61976234); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities; Sun Yat-sen University(grant numbers:22qntd2001); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9780164","Change detection (CD);cropland;deep learning (DL);remote sensing;transformer","Feature extraction;Transformers;Head;Data mining;Task analysis;Decoding;Biological system modeling","agriculture;convolutional neural nets;deep learning (artificial intelligence);feature extraction;geophysical image processing;image classification;image resolution;object detection;remote sensing","CNN-transformer network;multiscale context aggregation;fine-grained cropland change detection;nonagriculturalization incidents;local agricultural ecosystem;global food security;sensing change detection;in-time detection;high-resolution images;long-range context information;computational complexity;deep layers;MSCANet;CNN-based feature extractor;transformer-based MSCA;CNN classifiers;change maps;cropland change detection dataset;high-resolution semantic CD dataset;cropland CD;size 0.5 m to 2.0 m","","28","","51","CCBY","23 May 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To this end, we tend to explore the abundant channel information of multispectral and SAR data as a supplement to the refined spatial features of VHR images. We propose a new deep learning framework called multisource CD UNet++ (MSCDUNet), integrating multispectral, SAR, and VHR data for built-up area CD. First, we label and reform two new built-up area CD datasets containing multispectral, SAR, and VHR data: multisource built-up change (MSBC) and multisource OSCD (MSOSCD) datasets. Second, a feature selection method based on random forest is introduced to choose effective features from multispectral and SAR images. Finally, a multilevel heterogeneous feature fusion module is embedded in MSCDUNet to combine multifeatures for CD. Experiments are conducted on both the MSOSCD and the MSBC datasets.

Phase identification traditionally is executed manually, although there are existing voltage measurement based methods that are not always reliable. This paper develops a machine learning based data mining method for an accurate and efficient phase identification of residential customers in a distribution network by leveraging power consumption data collected through the advanced metering infrastructure (AMI). The proposed method uses a high-pass filter to remove the redundant and irrelevant parts of the power consumption time series, then identifies the residential customers' phase connectivity by proposing a modified clustering algorithm.

However, most existing subspace clustering methods consider data features as a whole and then focus only on one single self-representation. These approaches ignore the intrinsic multi-attribute information embedded in the original data feature and result in one–attribute self-representation. This paper proposes a novel multi-attribute subspace clustering (MASC) model that understands data from multiple attributes. MASC simultaneously learns multiple subspace representations corresponding to each specific attribute by exploiting the intrinsic multi-attribute features drawn from original data. In order to better capture the high-order correlation among multi-attribute representations, we represent them as a tensor in low-rank structure and propose the auto-weighted tensor nuclear norm (AWTNN) as a superior low-rank tensor approximation. Especially, the non-convex AWTNN fully considers the difference between singular values through the implicit and adaptive weights splitting during the AWTNN optimization procedure.

Unfortunately, the minable data publication is often implemented by publishers with limited privacy concerns such that the published dataset is minable by malicious entities. It prohibits minable data publication since the published data may contain sensitive information. Thus, it is urgently demanded to present some approaches and technologies for reducing the privacy leakage risks. To this end, in this paper, we propose an optimized sanitization approach for minable data publication (named as SA-MDP). SA-MDP supports association rules mining function while providing privacy protection for specific rules. In SA-MDP, we consider the trade-off between the data utility and the data privacy in the minable data publication problem. To address this problem, SA-MDP designs a customized particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm, where the optimization objective is determined by both the data utility and the data privacy. Specifically, we take advantage of PSO to produce new particles, which is achieved by random mutation or learning from the best particle. Hence, SA-MDP can avoid the solutions being trapped into local optima. Besides, we design a proper fitness function to guide the particles to run towards the optimal solution. Additionally, we present a preprocessing method before the evolution process of the customized PSO algorithm to improve the convergence rate. Finally, the proposed SA-MDP approach is performed and verified over several datasets. The experimental results have demonstrated the effectiveness and efficiency of SA-MDP.","2096-0654","","10.26599/BDMA.2022.9020007","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61932006); National Key R&D Program of China(grant numbers:2018AAA0100101); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9793357","data publication;data sanitization;association rules hiding;evolutionary algorithm","Data privacy;Privacy;Filtering;Sociology;Companies;Task analysis;Statistics","data mining;data privacy;particle swarm optimisation","SA-MDP;data utility;data privacy;minable data publication problem;optimized sanitization approach;data-driven tasks","","1","","32","","9 Jun 2022","","","TUP","TUP Journals"

Consequently, software product information security risk assessment has become an important task for most organisations. Several models have been proposed to help different enterprises deal with the challenges of building information security. This paper proposes a new hierarchical structured model for information security risk assessment using fuzzy logic.

To improve the session continuity, multiconnectivity and guard capacity mechanisms have been proposed recently. Multiconnectivity enables dynamic handover between multiple pre-established spatially-diverse links, while guard capacity reserves a fraction of radio resources for the already accepted sessions by ensuring that they will have sufficient provisions in case of link blockage. In this study, we combine the tools of queuing theory and stochastic geometry to develop a mathematical framework for capturing the joint operation of these two schemes as well as the features of mmWave radio propagation. The metrics are related to user- and system-centric performance including the system resource utilization and the new and ongoing session drop probabilities. Our results show that multiconnectivity benefits all of the considered parameters. However, the range of performance boost remains limited by the deployment density and the maximum supported degree of multiconnectivity. In its turn, guard capacity allows to further decrease the ongoing session drop probability at the expense of the new session drop probability and the system resource utilization. When implemented jointly with multiconnectivity, guard capacity does not produce noticeable negative effects on the system resource utilization as compared to its standalone use. Hence, one may prefer a joint implementation of these mechanisms for preserving the session continuity of users without compromising the resource utilization.","1939-9359","","10.1109/TVT.2021.3061906","Business Finland; Academy of Finland; RUDN University Strategic Academic Leadership Program; Konstantin Samouylov, supervision, project administration(grant numbers:19-07-00933); Eduard Sopin, mathematical model development(grant numbers:20-07-01064); Vyacheslav Begishev, visualization; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9362332","5G cellular systems;blockage mitigation;guard capacity;multiconnectivity;new radio technology;session continuity","Resource management;Measurement;Fading channels;Capacity planning;Vehicle dynamics;Receiving antennas;Propagation losses","5G mobile communication;millimetre wave communication;millimetre wave propagation;mobility management (mobile radio);probability;quality of service;queueing theory;stochastic processes","link blockage;mmWave radio propagation;system-centric performance;system resource utilization;multiconnectivity benefits;ongoing session drop probability;radio resources;guard capacity reserves;multiple pre-established spatially-diverse links;guard capacity mechanisms;5G New Radio technology;human-body blockage;millimeter wave links;millimeter-wave 5G NR systems;improved session continuity","","10","","39","IEEE","24 Feb 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, they fail to use a single model to accurately recover all frequency information encoded by missing significant bits at one time on challenging large bit-depth recovery tasks. In this paper, we redefine BDE residual recovery from the perspective of image frequency characteristics. On this basis, we propose an iterative residual feature optimization strategy, which provides an implicit error correction mechanism and improves training and inference efficiency. Furthermore, we design a simple but effective iterative residual feature refinement network (IRFRN). By linking model complexity with the recovery of different frequency information, IRFRN enables a single model to simultaneously recover the missing low and high frequency information.

We have designed and optimized a machine learning-based framework using inpatient’s facility data that will give a user-friendly, cost-effective, and time-efficient solution to this pandemic. The proposed framework uses Bayesian optimization to optimize the hyperparameters of the classifier and ADAptive SYNthetic (ADASYN) algorithm to balance the COVID and non-COVID classes of the dataset. Although the proposed technique has been applied to nine state-of-the-art classifiers to show the efficacy, it can be used to many classifiers and classification problems. It is evident from this study that eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGB) provides the highest Kappa index of 97.00%. Compared to without ADASYN, our proposed approach yields an improvement in the kappa index of 96.94%. Besides, Bayesian optimization has been compared to grid search, random search to show efficiency. Furthermore, the most dominating features have been identified using SHapely Adaptive exPlanations (SHAP) analysis. A comparison has also been made among other related works. The proposed method is capable enough of tracing COVID patients spending less time than that of the conventional techniques.

Nevertheless, developing accurate electricity consumption prediction models for buildings within the COVID-19 context is a nontrivial task. Correspondingly, this research focuses on incorporating publicly available internet data (i.e., Google Trends, Google Mobility, and COVID-19 data) to develop accurate electricity consumption prediction models for microgrid-based buildings during the COVID 19 pandemic. For this purpose, we developed extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), support vector regression (SVR), and autoregressive integrated moving average with explanatory variable (ARIMAX) models. As a case study, we analyzed a real-life electricity consumption dataset of a six-floor microgrid-designed educational building at a technological university in Bandung, West Java, Indonesia. The findings show that incorporating publicly online data positively impacts prediction accuracy. The accuracy increases, even more when we use the lagged value of the predictors. XGBoost models utilizing lagged historical values of the electricity consumption, Google Trends, and COVID-19 data of the previous days is the best performing model. However, adding more lagged predictors does not necessarily increase SVR models’ accuracy.

To assist image aesthetics assessment, we first model the semantics of an image as the topic features of its corresponding comments using Latent Dirichlet Allocation. We then propose a two-stream multitask learning framework for both topic feature prediction and aesthetic score distribution prediction. Topic feature prediction task enables to infer the semantics from images, since the comments are usually unavailable during inference and comment-guided semantics can only serve as supervision during training.

To ensure robust performance under unseen conditions, domain generalization has been explored. However, an inherent contradiction exists between model discrimination and domain generalization, in which the discrimination ability may be reduced while learning to generalize. In this paper, to extract discriminative yet domain-invariant representations, we propose the meta-generalized speaker verification (MGSV) via meta-learning. Specifically, we propose a metric-based distribution optimization and a gradient-based meta-optimization to simultaneously supervise the spatial relationship between embeddings and improve the generalization ability of the model on unseen domains. In addition, we design multiple-single (MS) and simulated speaker verification (SSV) sampling strategies based on single-domain (SD) and single-single (SS) strategies to simulate the train/test domain mismatch more relevantly, thereby mining transferable speaker-related knowledge. SSV is chosen as the most effective method, as it substantially improves the domain generalization by ensuring that the model has learned to discriminate efficiently. Additionally, to intuitively reflect the model performance on the unseen domains, the proposed method is validated on cross-genre, cross-device, and cross-dataset tasks.

There are two limitations when applying advanced detection methods naively for SAR ship detection. First, most detectors construct the model as an encoder and rely on the feature pyramid network (FPN) head for accurate prediction, which may lead to high computational costs. Second, the background noises in the ground truth (annotated as rectangular bounding boxes) of angular ships bring difficulties for model training. To meet these challenges, we propose an efficient encoder–decoder network with estimated direction for ship detection in SAR images. First, we present an anchor-free encoder–decoder model that can efficiently extract multiple-level features.

To that end, the research team has developed a mathematical model that applies machine learning to predict the effective process parameters. Since predicting process parameters requires a regression model, this research uses regression analysis algorithms such as the ridge regression and the random forest regressor. The paper analyzes whether these algorithms are applicable to the problem and tests the accuracy of their predictions. To generalize the approach and strengthen the justification of choosing the hyperparameters of the regression algorithms studied herein and considering the high variability of these hyperparameters, the multiobjective optimization technique applicable for this combinatorial problem - an (evolutionary) genetic algorithm - is proposed to determine effective sets of hyperparameters. All the models successfully addressed the task, achieving a forecasting accuracy of at least 89%. The article presents the final form of the ridge regression model describing the dependence of the weld’s depth and width: for the weld depth, there is a 2nd degree polynomial dependence with a regularization of 10−5, and for the weld width, there is a 3rd degree polynomial dependence with a regularization of 10−4. An automated system based on this approach that accurately predicts the process parameters is proposed herein. In addition to performing basic modeling functions, the proposed system allows the visualization of the model-predicted data in the form of an interactive plot. This function could be useful for technologists by allowing them to determine the process parameters that ensure the required weld dimensions. Adopting the proposed EBW parameter prediction method in practice will provide decision support for cases when engineers need to test the EBW process or to start making new products.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3092221","Ministry of Science and Higher Education of the Russian Federation “Development of the Theory of Self-Configuring Machine Learning Algorithms for Modeling and Predicting the Characteristics of Components of Complex Systems”(grant numbers:FEFE-2020-0013); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9464340","Electron beam welding;choice of process parameters;software;decision support;prediction;ridge regression;random forest;genetic algorithm;algorithm ensembles;machine learning","Welding;Prediction algorithms;Electron beams;Predictive models;Correlation;Random forests;Testing","electron beam welding;genetic algorithms;learning (artificial intelligence);polynomials;production engineering computing;regression analysis","electron beam welding;regression analysis algorithms;genetic algorithm;ridge regression model;weld depth;weld width;weld dimensions;EBW parameter prediction method;EBW process;multiobjective optimization technique","","15","","37","CCBY","24 Jun 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Due to the ongoing pandemic, nearly all businesses have adapted working models with remote operations. People engaged with major industries, e.g., academia, health and municipalities are utilizing online platforms to carryout their routine tasks. This indeed shifts the attention from one-to-one (unicast) communication to one-to-many (multicast) and many-to-many (multi-source multi-destination) communications. Network operators are facing increased pressure to provide quick responses in order to satisfy the bandwidth hungry and time sensitive user demands. This can only be done by enhancing deployability as well as manageability of the services. Network Function Virtualization (NFV) provides a transformation of traditional proprietary network designs to a more agile and software based environment in order to achieve flexible deployments, reduced setup costs and less-time-to-market for the new services which is very much needed in the current scenarios. Previous studies on NFV-enabled multicast problem either proposed Integer Linear Program (ILP) models, that are pretty unscalable, or heuristic-based techniques that do not guarantee good quality of the solutions obtained. In this article, we propose an NFV multicast resource optimization model exploiting the use of multiple sources and considering the end-to-end delay and bandwidth requirements. Herein, we propose a novel Dantzig-Wolfe (DW) decomposition model that tackles the complexity of the problem by breaking it down into a master problem and several pricing problems. We compare the DW approach with the ILP and heuristic methods and demonstrate that our approach achieves near to optimal solution (in comparison to heuristic based methods) much faster than ILP. We also study the dynamic admission of NFV-enabled multicast requests by solving the problem in an online manner using the batch processing of requests.

This method first generates root nodes by preprocessing; secondly, the frequency of words is counted, and the word with the largest frequency is extracted as the segmentation condition to refine the template generated by the root node. So on recursively, pattern nodes are formed for all elements of the nodes, and corresponding templates are generated to finally achieve the purpose of log pattern mining. The mining process of the log patterns is from coarse to fine which is based on fewer assumptions, and the pattern fitting depth can be controlled by adjusting the termination condition. In optimized algorithm model, we also consider the maximum extent of the log template matching the token in the log message. The experimental results show that this method effectively improves the log parsing quality and has higher log parsing accuracy than other methods, and is more suitable for handling logs with complex structures.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3239012","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:52275136); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10024775","Log parsing;offline algorithm;PatCluster;frequent words","Feature extraction;Clustering algorithms;Deep learning;Pattern matching;Frequency measurement;Task analysis;Optimization","data mining;file organisation;grammars;natural language processing;system monitoring","dynamic variable fields;frequent words;higher log parsing accuracy;largest frequency;log message;log pattern mining;log patterns;log template;offline log parsing method;PatCluster;pattern fitting depth;pattern nodes;root node;static message type fields;subsequent log analysis tasks","","","","20","CCBY","23 Jan 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Besides, the classical unsupervised sparse constraint weakens the evaluation of feature importance and neglects the preservation of discriminant information during sparse representation. To solve these issues, a novel fuzzy discriminative block representation learning (FDBRL) algorithm is proposed for image feature extraction. FDBRL aims to enhance the discriminability of subspace by designing effective constraints for projection learning. Specifically, based on the label information and the fuzzy relation between data, we construct a fuzzy block weight matrix and embed it into the  ${l_{2,1}}$  norm regularization term to realize supervised sparse constraint for the representation learning. Next, the low-rank constraint is used to capture the inherent global structure information of data. Finally, we introduce a classification loss term with transformation matrix for joint optimization, such that the projection learning is not limited to number of classes, and the discriminative ability is further improved.

Node clustering is an essential part of this task. And several clustering algorithms have been proposed. As all these algorithms contain complicated optimization procedure and matrix calculation procedure, complexity of these algorithms is very high. To overcome the shortage described above, in this paper, a new clustering algorithm is proposed. In this algorithm, several parameters should be inputted. These parameters include a heterogeneous information network, meta-paths that are used and the names of target types. During the clustering procedure, a homogeneous network will be built by the proposed algorithm firstly. All the target objects of HIN are treated as nodes of this network. The instances of meta-paths are edges. After the homogeneous network is constructed, label propagation procedure can be performed. Then the clustering result will be obtained. Obviously, by using the proposed algorithm to perform clustering, the complex optimization procedure and matrix calculation procedure are eliminated. As the convergence rate of label propagation procedure is fast, the proposed algorithm is very efficient. Besides, we can find that label propagation procedure can be executed in parallel. Thus, the proposed algorithm is easy to be parallelized. In this situation, it is fit for processing large scale HIN based on server cluster. From experimental results, we can find that the proposed algorithm running faster than all the other algorithms for comparison.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3115605","Inner Mongolia University of Technology Research Fund Key Project(grant numbers:ZZ201908); Inner Mongolia Key Technological Development Program(grant numbers:2019ZD015); Key Scientific and Technological Research Program of Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region(grant numbers:2019GG273); Inner Mongolia University of Technology Research Project Doctoral Fund(grant numbers:BS2020040); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62062054); Natural Science Foundation of Inner Mongolia Autonomous Doctoral Fund(grant numbers:2020BS06007); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9548102","Heterogeneous information networks;clustering;community detection;label propagation;graph mining","Clustering algorithms;Prediction algorithms;Optimization;Task analysis;Servers;Microbiology;Medical services","data mining;information networks;matrix algebra;optimisation;pattern clustering","heterogeneous information network;matrix calculation procedure;clustering procedure;homogeneous network;label propagation procedure;complex optimization procedure;node clustering algorithm;network technology","","","","31","CCBYNCND","24 Sep 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The idea of spatial crowdsourcing is recruiting a set of available crowds to finish the spatial tasks located in crowdsourcing locations, e.g., landmarks, by using their handheld devices. This paper addresses the worker recruitment problem in spatial crowdsourcing under the coverage and workload-balancing requirements. The coverage constraint means that any crowdsourcing location should be visited by at least one of the recruited workers to satisfy the Quality-of-Service requirement, e.g., traffic monitoring or climate forecast. In addition, we argue that each crowdsourcing operation has a cost in reality, e.g., data traffic or energy consumption and the resource may be limited at each crowdsourcing location. The objective of this paper is to solve a Coverage and Balanced Crowdsourcing Recruiting (CBCR) problem, which ensures the coverage requirement and minimizes the maximum crowdsourcing cost for any crowdsourcing location. We prove that the CBCR problem is NP-hard in the general case. Then, we discuss the CBCR problem in the 1-D scenario. In the 1-D scenario, we first propose a directionally coverage scheme and further extend it to a Polynomial-Time Approximation Scheme (PTAS) to trade-off the computation complexity and the performance. The performance can be bounded to 2 + ε, where ε can be an arbitrary small value. Then, we found that there exists a sub-optimal structure, and thus the dynamic programming approach is proposed to find the optimal solution in the 1-D scenario. In the general 2-D scenario, we first prove that it has a sub-modular property and thus the naive greedy algorithm has an approximation ratio of ln n + 1. In addition, we propose a randomized rounding algorithm with an expectation bound of O(logn / log logn). Extensive experiments on realistic traces demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.","2332-7790","","10.1109/TBDATA.2018.2865755","National Science Foundation(grant numbers:CNS 1757533,CNS 1629746,CNS 1564128,CNS 1449860,CNS 1461932,CNS 1460971,IIP 1439672); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8438972","Mobile edge computing;spatial crowdsourcing;task allocation;mobile networks","Crowdsourcing;Task analysis;Trajectory;Sensors;Big Data;Wireless sensor networks;Recruitment","approximation theory;business data processing;computational complexity;crowdsourcing;dynamic programming;greedy algorithms;mobile computing;recruitment","coverage requirement;spatial crowdsourcing;spatial tasks;workload-balancing requirements;crowdsourcing location;recruited workers;crowdsourcing operation;crowdsourcing cost;CBCR problem;heterogeneous worker recruitment;Coverage and Balanced Crowdsourcing Recruiting;Quality-of-Service requirement;mobile devices;polynomial-time approximation scheme;dynamic programming;randomized rounding algorithm","","14","","41","IEEE","17 Aug 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The existing pansharpening methods, in general, have the problems of spectral distortion and lack of spatial detail information. To mitigate these problems, we propose a multiscale hybrid attention Transformer pansharpening network (MHATP-Net). In the proposed network, the shallow feature (SF) is first acquired through an SF extraction module (SFEM), which contains the convolutional block attention module (CBAM) and dynamic convolution blocks. The CBAM in this module can filter initial information roughly, and the dynamic convolution blocks can enrich the SF information. Then, the multiscale Transformer module is used to obtain multiencoding feature images.

However, it is very challenging to extract roads around the thorny occlusion areas, even in high-resolution remote sensing images. Existing approaches regard road extraction as an isolated binary segmentation task and ignore the surroundings’ contextual information in the optical image itself, especially the potential dependence implied between roads and buildings. To address the occlusion problem, we proposed a spatial attention-based road extraction neural network using contextual relation between roads and buildings named MSACon to extract the roads more precisely. First, we employed an existing building extraction method to predict buildings in the optical images. Second, we calculated the signed distance map (SDM) based on the building extraction results (which may be inaccurate) as ambiguous auxiliary information to infer the optical images’ potential roads. Due to the color, lines, and texture between the optical images and the SDM are distinct, we then designed the two-branch encoder to extract features and integrated the cross-domain features into the road decoder by a spatial attention-based fusion mechanism. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior performance than other state-of-the-art approaches even with ambiguous auxiliary information. Furthermore, MSACon shows obvious advantages in finding inconspicuous roads in the optical images and eliminating noisy roads, especially when dealing with areas where buildings are located along the roads.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2021.3073923","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61806211,41971362,U19A2058); Natural Science Foundation of Hunan Province China(grant numbers:2020JJ4103); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9419675","Contextual information;road extraction;roads and buildings;signed distance map (SDM);spatial attention mechanism","Roads;Data mining;Buildings;Feature extraction;Optical imaging;Optical sensors;Image segmentation","data mining;deep learning (artificial intelligence);feature extraction;geophysical image processing;image colour analysis;image fusion;image resolution;image segmentation;image texture;optical images;remote sensing;roads","optical image;spatial attention-based road extraction neural network;MSACon;ambiguous auxiliary information;road decoder;spatial attention-based fusion mechanism;mining spatial attention-based contextual information;high-resolution remote sensing images;noisy roads;building extraction;deep learning;isolated binary segmentation;contextual relation;signed distance map;SDM;image color;image lines;image texture;two-branch encoder;feature extraction;cross-domain features","","11","","73","IEEE","29 Apr 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To this end, we develop a novel, sophisticated yet intuitive image-based representation for COBs using two-dimensional heat maps. This heat map representation contributes significantly to the development of a novel COB classification framework. In this framework, we utilize data enrichment via synthetical training samples to train a CNN model that performs the classification task. Integrating synthetically generated data into the training phase allows us to strengthen the inclusion of rare pattern variants that we identified during initial analysis. Moreover, we show how this framework is used in practice at Infineon.

First, most of the existing methods usually mine the pseudoground-truth (PGT) instances solely relying on proposal class scores (PCSs). Actually, the reliability of PCS is not enough because of the bird’s eye view imaging and large-scale chaotic background of RSIs, and the instances with high PCS incline to cover the discriminative region, rather than the whole object. Second, the existing methods assign a one-hot label to each instance, and the label of the PGT instance is copied to its neighbor instances, which induces the misclassification problem to some extent. Actually, the probability that the neighbor instances contain the object with the same category is smaller than the PGT instance. For the first problem, the proposal quality score (PQS) is proposed for mining high-quality PGT instances, which contain PCS and dual-context projection score (DCPS). The DCPS is calculated through semantic segmentation and is employed to measure the completeness that each proposal covers an object. For the second problem, a pseudosoft label assignment (PSLA) strategy is proposed to assign a more precise soft label for each instance, where the soft label is determined by the spatial distance between each instance and its nearest PGT instance. The ablation study validates the effectiveness of the PQS and PSLA.

To this end, traditional methods operate at the action level and rely on complicated strategies to prepare triplet samples, which only mines the cross-video relationships among three videos from two categories. In this work, we observe that action instances from different categories could exhibit similar motion patterns, i.e. subaction, and propose to operate at the sub-action granularity to elaborately explore cross-video relationships. However, only given video-level category labels, the sub-actions are undefined and not annotated. To tackle this challenge, we represent video features via a group of sub-actions, i.e. the sub-action family. Specifically, the sub-action family contains multiple feature vectors, where each vector is in charge of representing a specific sub-action. The sub-action family is shared among all videos in the dataset, while all videos contribute to the learning of the sub-action family. Consequently, we can not only get rid of the complicated sampling strategy but also thoroughly mine cross-video relationships from all available videos in the dataset. To learn feature vectors within the sub-action family, we employ a bottom-up temporal action localization paradigm and introduce an extra top-down branch. The sub-action family is introduced into the top-down branch, and it learns feature vectors via representing raw video features. Moreover, we propose a consistency loss to guide the learning process and a diversity loss to mine distinct sub-actions. Extensive experiments are carried out on three benchmark datasets, i.e. THUMOS14, ActivityNet v1.2 and ActivityNet v1.3, and the proposed method builds new high performance.","1558-2205","","10.1109/TCSVT.2021.3089323","National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)(grant numbers:61771391); Science, Technology and Innovation Commission of Shenzhen Municipality(grant numbers:JCYJ20170815162956949,JCYJ20180306171146740); Key Research and Development Plan of Shaanxi Province(grant numbers:2020ZDLGY07-11); Natural Science Basic Research Plan in Shaanxi Province of China(grant numbers:2018JM6056); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9454500","Weakly supervised learning;temporal action localization;sub-action granularity","Location awareness;Proposals;Task analysis;Aggregates;Training;Prediction algorithms;Marine vehicles","computer vision;feature extraction;gesture recognition;image classification;image motion analysis;image recognition;learning (artificial intelligence);object detection;pattern classification;pattern clustering;video signal processing","temporal action localization paradigm;sub-action family;raw video features;mine distinct sub-actions;sub-action granularity;modeling cross-video relationship;weakly supervised temporal action localization task;action level;action instances;given video-level category labels;specific sub-action;thoroughly mine cross-video relationships","","9","","71","IEEE","14 Jun 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In recent years, CD tasks have made many attempts in pure convolutional networks, attention mechanism, and transformer, and have achieved good results. Based on the power of attention and transformers, we hope to find a method that can handle the details of the image better and has better generalization ability. In this article, we propose a dual-feature mixed attention-based transformer network (DMATNet). First, we adopt a dual-feature extraction method, using a simple convolutional neural network (CNN) to extract coarse features, and a CNN based on progressive sampling to extract fine features. Then, we fuse the fine and coarse features with dual-feature mixed attention (DFMA) module. It can not only extract more specific regions of interest, but also overcome the misjudgment caused by oversampling, and synchronize feature extraction and target information integration. Finally, we use transformer to optimize these extracted information and feedback into the original features in the encoder to help remodel the pixel space. We merged the DMAT network into a deep feature difference-based CD framework and conducted extensive experiments on four datasets, LEVIR-CD, DSIFN-CD, WHU-CD, and CLCD, respectively, with tested F1 and interconnection over union (IoU) results of 90.75%/84.13%, 71.23%/55.32%, 85.70%/74.98%, and 66.56%/59.87%.

Traditional systems are not useful to meet these critical issues because these systems have not a consistent structure for data security and reliability policies. Therefore, a new solution is required to enhance data accessibility and should regulate government security policies to ensure the accountability of the usage of the medical records system. Moreover, it is also required to analyze historical data of veterinary clinic using data mining and machine learning techniques to predict the future appointments scheduling requests, which is essential for veterinary management to drive better future decisions, for instance, future demands of medical supplies and to plan veterinary medical staff, etc. This paper aims to fill the gap by proposing a novel blockchain-based reliable and intelligent veterinary information management system (RIVIMS) using smart contract and machine learning techniques. The proposed RIVIMS consists of two main modules; blockchain-based secured veterinary information management, data and predictive analytics modules. First, a blockchain-based secure and reliable veterinary clinic information management system is developed using Hyperledger Fabric. Second, a smart contract enabled data, and predictive analytics modules are developed using permissioned blockchain framework. The data and predictive modules aim to analyze veterinary clinic patients appointments data in order to discover underlying patterns and build a robust prediction model using machine learning algorithms. The data and predictive helps veterinary management to drive better future business decisions to provide better healthcare services to veterinary patients. Hyperledger Caliper is used as a benchmark tool to evaluate the performance of the developed blockchain-based system in terms of transaction per second, transaction success rate, transaction throughput, and transaction latency.

In this paper, we propose and develop a novel worker recruitment game in socially aware MCS, i.e., Acceptance-aware Worker Recruitment (AWR). To accommodate MCS task invitation diffusion over social networks, we design a Random Diffusion model, where workers randomly propagate task invitations to social neighbors, and receivers independently make a decision whether to accept or not. Based on the diffusion model, we formulate the AWR game as a combinatorial optimization problem, which strives to search a subset of seed workers to maximize overall task acceptance under a pre-given incentive budget. We prove its NP hardness, and devise a meta-heuristic-based evolutionary approach named MA-RAWR to balance exploration and exploitation during the search process.

Finding top-$k$k persistent items is a new issue, and has attracted increasing attention in recent years. In practice, users often want to know which items are significant, i.e., not only frequent but also persistent. No prior art can address both of the above two issues at the same time. Also, for high-speed data streams, prior art cannot achieve high accuracy when the memory is tight. In this paper, we define a new issue, named finding significant items, and propose a novel algorithm namely LTC to address this issue. It includes two key techniques, Long-tail Restoring and CLOCK, as well as three optimizations. In addition, LTC is extended to support finding significant items with thresholds.

Most existing methods are trained in a fully-supervised or a weakly-supervised manner, which requires a time-consuming and expensive manually labeling process. In this work, we propose an alternative approach to achieving video moment retrieval that requires no textual annotations of videos and instead leverages the existing visual concept detectors and a pre-trained image-sentence embedding space. Specifically, we design a video-conditioned sentence generator to produce a suitable sentence representation by utilizing the mined visual concepts in videos. We then design a GNN-based relation-aware moment localizer to reasonably select a portion of video clips under the guidance of the generated sentence. Finally, the pre-trained image-sentence embedding space is adopted to evaluate the matching scores between the generated sentence and moment representations with the knowledge transferred from the image domain. By maximizing these scores, the sentence generator and moment localizer can enhance and complement each other to achieve the moment retrieval task. Experimental results on the Charades-STA and ActivityNet Captions datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method.","1558-2205","","10.1109/TCSVT.2021.3075470","National Key Research and Development Plan of China(grant numbers:2020AAA0106200); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62036012,61721004,62072286,61720106006,61832002,62072455,62002355,U1836220,U1705262); Key Research Program of Frontier Sciences of Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS)(grant numbers:QYZDJSSWJSC039); Beijing Natural Science Foundation(grant numbers:L201001); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9415694","Video moment retrieval;graph neural network;unpaired learning","Visualization;Task analysis;Generators;Training;Graph neural networks;Semantics;Detectors","data mining;image classification;image motion analysis;image retrieval;learning (artificial intelligence);natural language processing;object detection;query processing;video signal processing","video moment retrieval;single annotated video;existing visual concept detectors;video-conditioned sentence generator;suitable sentence representation;GNN-based relation-aware moment localizer;video clips;generated sentence;pre-trained image-sentence embedding space;moment representations;moment retrieval task","","10","","83","IEEE","26 Apr 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In addition, COVID-19 is likely to have a long-term effect on risk evaluation in the Indo-Pacific states. Therefore, it is vital to oversee and execute remedial activities quickly and successfully, amid the COVID-19 pandemic. This paper proposes a national defense and military budget planning strategy. It applies a decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory linguistic data strategy for group decision-making, in order to collect group opinions and analyze the causal relationship of complicated social science issues in indistinct situations. These concepts are divided into causal and impact groups, to provide an improved understanding of the relationship among them, as well as making recommendations to improve their general execution. This paper employed the fuzzy DEMATEL method to analyze the model and considered suggestions as the key influencing factors in budget planning strategy. Through this well-constructed fuzzy DEMATEL approach our research results show that a proper operations strategy and management of both resource usage and task arrangement in accordance with policy making will accomplish excellent budget planning strategy results. The results reveal that the Mission Requirement is a major causal factor. The study can provide a successful national defense and military budget strategy assessment with satisfactory criteria that fit the decision-makers’ requirements, particularly when the assessment criteria are various and entwined.

To achieve optimal performance of Big Data analytics workloads, a careful configuration of the cluster and the employed software framework is required. The lack of flexible and accurate performance models, however, render this a challenging task. This article fills this gap by presenting accurate performance prediction models based on Stochastic Activity Networks (SANs). In contrast to existing work, the presented models consider multiple work queues, a critical feature to achieve high accuracy in realistic usage scenarios. We first introduce a monolithic analytical model for a multi-queue YARN cluster running DAG-based Big Data applications that models each queue individually. To overcome the limited scalability of the monolithic model, we then present a fixed-point model that iteratively computes the throughput of a single queue with respect to the rest of the system until a fixed-point is reached. The models are evaluated on a real-world cluster running the widely-used Apache Spark framework and the YARN scheduler. Experiments with the common transaction-based TPC-DS benchmark show that the proposed models achieve an average error of only $5.6\%$5.6% in predicting the execution time of the Spark jobs. The presented models enable businesses to optimize their cluster configuration for a given workload and thus to reduce their expenses and minimize service level agreement (SLA) violations.

Buses are an indispensable way of moving for urban residents with fixed routes and schedules, which leads to latent travel regularity. However, human mobility patterns, specifically the complex relationships between bus passengers, are deeply hidden in this fixed mobility mode. Although many models exist to predict traffic flow, human mobility patterns have not been well explored in this regard. To address this research gap and learn human mobility knowledge from this fixed travel behaviors, we propose a multi-pattern passenger flow prediction framework, MPGCN, based on Graph Convolutional Network (GCN). Firstly, we construct a novel sharing-stop network to model relationships between passengers based on bus record data. Then, we employ GCN to extract features from the graph by learning useful topology information and introduce a deep clustering method to recognize mobility patterns hidden in bus passengers. Furthermore, to fully utilize spatio-temporal information, we propose GCN2Flow to predict passenger flow based on various mobility patterns. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first work to adopt a multi-pattern approach to predict the bus passenger flow by taking advantage of graph learning. We design a case study for optimizing routes. Extensive experiments upon a real-world bus dataset demonstrate that MPGCN has potential efficacy in passenger flow prediction and route optimization.","1558-0016","","10.1109/TITS.2022.3148116","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62072409); Zhejiang Provincial Natural Science Foundation(grant numbers:LR21F020003); Fundamental Research Funds for the Provincial Universities of Zhejiang(grant numbers:RF-B2020001); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9709191","Spatio-temporal data mining;human mobility pattern;graph convolutional networks;passenger flow prediction;smart city","Autoregressive processes;Predictive models;Task analysis;Optimization;Data models;Australia;Smart cities","feature extraction;graph theory;learning (artificial intelligence);mobile computing;mobility management (mobile radio);optimisation;pattern clustering;road traffic;road vehicles;telecommunication network routing;traffic engineering computing;transportation","Graph learning framework;traffic flow prediction;intelligent transportation system;traffic-related applications;fixed routes;latent travel regularity;human mobility patterns;bus passengers;fixed mobility mode;human mobility knowledge;fixed travel behaviors;multipattern passenger flow prediction framework;Graph Convolutional Network;GCN;bus record data;multipattern approach;bus passenger flow;route optimization;multipattern passenger prediction","","9","","49","IEEE","9 Feb 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Since the update rule of RMS is closer to BMS, the convergence of point iterates is conjectured based on the Chen’s BMS convergence theorem. Experimental results on synthetic and real datasets show that RMS in several cases outperforms MS and BMS in the clustering task. In addition, RMS exhibits larger attraction basins than MS and BMS for identical parametrization; consequently, its kernel variant requires a lower aperture of the kernel function, and its NN variant a lower number of nearest neighbors compared to MS or BMS, to achieve optimal clustering results. In addition, the NN version of RMS does not need to specify a convergence threshold to stop the iterations, contrarily to the NN-BMS algorithm.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3147951","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9698033","Data mining;data clustering;mean-shift;kernel-based method;nearest neighbors","Convergence;Kernel;Bandwidth;Clustering algorithms;Task analysis;Standards;Sensitivity","Gaussian processes;iterative methods;nearest neighbour methods;optimisation;pattern clustering","MS;clustering task;RMS;kernel variant;nearest neighbors;optimal clustering results;NN-BMS algorithm;mean-shift algorithm;data clustering;update equation;nearest-neighbor-based fashion;update rule;Chen BMS convergence theorem;blurring mean-shift;standard mean-shift;robust mean-shift;NN variant","","8","","42","CCBY","31 Jan 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The lack of data hinders the development of novel materials. The figures and captions in the material literature cover essential information regarding the entire document and have sufficient image sample data for research. Accordingly, how to extract figures and captions from the literature is critical to solve the lack of data. Though some PDF parsing tools are capable of extracting information from documents, they generally identify a document's figures by parsing the document into a concrete structure. As impacted by the inconsistency of the form of different journals, they commonly achieve wrong recognition results. Thus, an efficient figure and caption extraction network FCENet is proposed in the present study. Inconsistent with other extraction tools, this study first attempts to adopt instance segmentation models to detect figures and their captions, and then extract them. FCENet developed in this study builds upon BlendMask and introduces a horizontal and vertical attention module. This study splits the BlendMask detection head into two branches, i.e., figure detection and caption detection, which increases final detection accuracy and speed. This study collects nearly 3000 material documents for model training and testing. As revealed from the last experiments and results, the performance of FCENet is significantly compared with that of other existing instance segmentation models. Its box and mask mAP (mean Average Precision) are 8.51% and 12.59% higher than those of BlendMask, respectively.

Due to the dramatic domain gap between the ground and aerial images, the problem is challenging. The existing approaches mainly adopt convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to learn discriminative features. However, these CNN-based methods mainly leverage appearance and semantic information but fail to jointly model the appearance, positional, and orientation properties of scene objects, which belong to the spatial hierarchy. Since spatial hierarchy information is crucial for cross-view feature correspondence, in this article, we propose an end-to-end network architecture, dubbed GeoNet. GeoNet consists of a ResNetX module and a GeoCaps module. On the one hand, the ResNetX module is developed to learn powerful intermediate feature maps and allows the stable propagation of gradients in deep CNNs. On the other hand, the GeoCaps module utilizes the capsule network to encapsulate the intermediate feature maps into several capsules, whose length and orientation represent the existence probability and spatial hierarchy information of scene objects, respectively. Moreover, by using a dynamic routing-by-agreement mechanism, the GeoCaps module is capable of modeling parts-to-whole relationships between scene objects, which is viewpoint invariant and capable of bridging the cross-view domain gap.

Style feature is a set of correlation matrix based on style image, namely Gram matrix. Each matrix is a global description of the style image. This kind of methods can perform well in the insensitive semantic scenes (such as the style transfer between landscape photos), but in the sensitive semantic scenes (such as the style transfer between portrait photos), the problem of semantic mismatch will be highlighted, such as transferring the background texture of the style image to the foreground of the target image. Although the existing research takes the manually annotated semantic image as an input of the algorithm, and then guides the style transfer based on the semantic information, and finally achieves good results in the style transfer between portraits. But there are still two problems: first, semantic images need to be manually annotated, which costs human resources. In practical applications, large-scale image style transfer is often needed. Second, the details of the synthesized image are fuzzy, and the definition is not enough. We propose an image style transfer algorithm based on semantic segmentation to resolve semantic mismatching in image style transfer. Our algorithm extracts the semantic information of style image and content image automatically through a semantic segmentation network and uses the semantic information to guide the style transfer. Our algorithm builds a semantic segmentation network based on mask R-CNN, introduces semantic information, and then makes style transfer on the patch level, realizes the style transfer between similar objects (consistent semantic information). Experiments on Celeba and Wikiart show that our method could automatically extract the semantic information of style image and content image. Compared with the state-of-art approaches in this field, our method can effectively avoid semantic mismatch in the process of image style transfer. That is, it can maintain semantic consistency in the process of style transfer.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3054969","Construction and Verification of Digital Identity System for Folk Cultural Relics(grant numbers:2020YFC1523201); Research on Key Methods of Intelligent Extraction, Understanding and Generation of Elements in Large Ruins(grant numbers:2020YFC1523101); Collaborative Processing and Intelligent Computing Engine of Digital Cultural Heritage(grant numbers:2020YFC1522701); Research on Key Technology of Image Inpainting based on Background Knowledge Constraint(grant numbers:LY21F020005); Management Oriented Network Mechanism Design and Data Mining Method(grant numbers:LGF19F020003); Research on Key Techniques of Image Inpainting based on Weak Supervised Learning(grant numbers:LY19F020049); Research on Image Semantic Segmentation Technology(grant numbers:LY20G010003); Research on Pattern Creative Design Technology(grant numbers:2019C03137); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9336718","Image style transfer;semantic segmentation;semantic mismatching;feature extraction;fine semantic guidance;mask R-CNN","Semantics;Feature extraction;Image segmentation;Data mining;Optimization;Kernel;Training","feature extraction;fuzzy set theory;image segmentation;image texture","semantic mismatch;style image;manually annotated semantic image;semantic information;semantic images;large-scale image style transfer;semantic mismatching;content image;semantic segmentation network;image style transfer algorithm;mask R-CNN;Celeba;Wikiart;synthesized image;human resources","","4","","29","CCBY","27 Jan 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The challenges of the task are to deeply understand the story context, mine the storylines hidden in the story, and generate rational endings in logic and sentiment. Although existing pre-trained approaches have been proven effective to this task, how to learn to generate endings with appropriate plots and sufficient sentimental information still remains a major challenge. One possible reason is that an over reliance on external commonsense knowledge beyond the storylines and sentimental trends information hidden in the story context could lead to generation deviating from the main theme. To address this issue, we propose a two-stage Stroylines and Sentiment Aware Pre-trained model (SSAP) for generating sentimentally relevant story endings. We apply a classifier for discriminating the sentiment of the story, and then employ a pre-trained language model, combining with storylines information, to conditionally generate sentences that match both the logic and sentiment of the story.

Each process available in the platform requires input files and produces output files by using cloud storage as a repository and it is delivered by the owner as a self-contained Docker image, whose digest is safely stored in the chain.

Due to the exponential number of possible label sets to be considered by the predictive model, it is commonly assumed that label correlations should be well exploited to design an effective multi-label learning approach. On the other hand, class-imbalance stands as an intrinsic property of multi-label data which significantly affects the generalization performance of the multi-label predictive model. For each class label, the number of training examples with positive labeling assignment is generally much less than those with negative labeling assignment. To deal with the class-imbalance issue for multi-label learning, a simple yet effective class-imbalance aware learning strategy called cross-coupling aggregation (COCOA) is proposed in this article. Specifically, COCOA works by leveraging the exploitation of label correlations as well as the exploration of class-imbalance simultaneously. For each class label, a number of multiclass imbalance learners are induced by randomly coupling with other labels, whose predictions on the unseen instance are aggregated to determine the corresponding labeling relevancy.

To quantitatively calculate the trust, a trust evaluation index system is established that comprehensively considers the influencing factors in the production, transaction, and collaboration processes of cloud manufacturing services. The trust value is synthesized based on all index values using the criteria importance through intercriteria correlation method. To extract the temporal information in historical trust data, a time-aware predictive trust evaluation method based on gated recurrent unit is proposed to learn the changing pattern of trust value over time. The trust data are trained together with their timestamps to predict the trust in the scheduled transaction time. The correlation between services in service composition is modeled to mine the correlation information by association analysis.

In this work, we propose $\mathsf {Hydra}$Hydra, a multi-task deep learning based recommendation system that offers multi-modal transportation planning and is adaptive to various situational context (e.g., nearby point-of-interest (POI) distribution and weather). We leverage the availability of existing routing engines and big urban data, and design a novel two-level framework that integrates uni-modal and multi-modal (e.g., taxi-bus, bus-cycle) routes as well as heterogeneous urban data for intelligent multi-modal transportation recommendation. In addition to urban context features constructed from multi-source urban data, we learn the latent representations of users, origin-destination (OD) pairs and transportation modes based on user implicit feedbacks, which captures the collaborative transportation mode preferences of users and OD pairs. Moreover, we propose two models to recommend the proper route among various uni-modal and multi-modal transportation routes: (1) a light-weight gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT) based recommendation model; and (2) a multi-task wide and deep learning (MTWDL) based recommendation model.

In this article, we introduce a new evolutionary approach for WSI representation based on large-scale multiobjective optimization (LSMOP) of deep embeddings. We start with patch-based sampling to feed KimiaNet, a histopathology-specialized deep network, and to extract a multitude of feature vectors. Coarse multiobjective feature selection uses the reduced search space strategy guided by the classification accuracy and the number of features. In the second stage, the frequent features histogram (FFH), a novel WSI representation, is constructed by multiple runs of coarse LSMOP. Fine evolutionary feature selection is then applied to find a compact (short-length) feature vector based on the FFH and contributes to a more robust deep-learning approach to digital pathology supported by the stochastic power of evolutionary algorithms. We validate the proposed schemes using The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) images in terms of WSI representation, classification accuracy, and feature quality. Furthermore, a novel decision space for multicriteria decision making in the LSMOP field is introduced. Finally, a patch-level visualization approach is proposed to increase the interpretability of deep features.

Specifically, we consider distributed gradient descent computing with coding when a task publisher (TP) with a limited amount of budget offers incentives to encourage MDs' participation in the computation. To analyze a hierarchical decision-making structure of the TP and MDs, we formulate a strategic competition between them as a Stackelberg game. In the case that the MDs are the leaders, we design a CPU-cycle frequency control scheme to balance each MD's computing speed and energy consumption for obtaining its maximum utility with the incentive mechanisms. As the follower, the TP aims at minimizing latency of the DC, and it follows the MDs' decisions to determine the load allocation for each MD. Then, we design an algorithm achieving the Stackelberg equilibrium, which is shown to be a unique Nash equilibrium of the game. The performance evaluation results show that the proposed mechanisms achieve 39% of LR on average compared to the benchmark mechanism.

Regardless of the number of data made available, annotation requires significant human effort, which is expensive and time-consuming. Moreover, collecting labeled data that reflect contemporary surrounding statuses requires exhaustive follow-up and incurs correspondingly higher costs. Current NERs typically focus on the supervised learning of hand-crafted data. The most well-known dataset for NER shared tasks, which was released at the 2003 Conference on Natural Language Learning, is used for basic training and evaluation. Although the data are qualified, the database has low coverage of timely material. In this paper, we illustrate methods for swiftly labeling up-to-date data via distant supervision.

In recent years, nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) has received great attention in the HU due to its simultaneous estimation, flexible modeling, and little requirement on prior information. However, several common NMF algorithms still suffer from high computational complexity, instability, and low convergence rate. Motivated by the matrix manifold theory, this article proposes a new sparse oblique-manifold ( $\mathcal {OB}$ ) NMF method from the perspective of matrix manifold. The critical idea of the proposed method is to regard the abundance matrix as locating on the oblique manifold, which eliminates its constraint of nonnegativity and sum-to-one and incorporates its intrinsic Riemannian geometry.

However, it can only be achieved at the expense of images’ spatial resolution. HSI super-resolution (HSI-SR), thus, addresses this problem by fusing low-resolution (LR) HSI with the multispectral image (MSI) carrying much higher spatial resolution (HR). Existing HSI-SR approaches require the LR HSI and HR MSI to be well registered, and the reconstruction accuracy of the HR HSI relies heavily on the registration accuracy of different modalities. In this article, we propose an unregistered and unsupervised mutual Dirichlet-Net ( $u^{2}$ -MDN) to exploit the uncharted problem domain of HSI-SR without the requirement of multimodality registration. The success of this endeavor would largely facilitate the deployment of HSI-SR since registration requirement is difficult to satisfy in real-world sensing devices. The novelty of this work is threefold. First, to stabilize the fusion procedure of two unregistered modalities, the network is designed to extract spatial information and spectral information of two modalities with different dimensions through a shared encoder–decoder structure. Second, the mutual information (MI) is further adopted to capture the nonlinear statistical dependencies between the representations from two modalities (carrying spatial information) and their raw inputs. By maximizing the MI, spatial correlations between different modalities can be well characterized to further reduce the spectral distortion. We assume that the representations follow a similar Dirichlet distribution for their inherent sum-to-one and nonnegative properties. Third, a collaborative  $l_{2,1}$ -norm is employed as the reconstruction error instead of the more common  $l_{2}$ -norm to better preserve the spectral information. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of  $u^{2}$ -MDN as compared to the state of the art.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2021.3079518","National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)(grant numbers:NNX12CB05C,NNX16CP38P); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9442804","Hyperspectral image (HSI);mutual information (MI);super-resolution (SR);unregistered;unsupervised deep learning","Spatial resolution;Image reconstruction;Data mining;Bayes methods;Superresolution;Tensors;Optimization","computer vision;geophysical image processing;hyperspectral imaging;image fusion;image reconstruction;image registration;image representation;image resolution;remote sensing;statistical analysis","registration requirement;mutual information;spatial correlations;computer vision;remote sensing tasks;HSI superresolution;low-resolution HSI;multispectral image;LR HSI;unregistered Dirichlet-Net;unsupervised mutual Dirichlet-Net;unregistered hyperspectral image superresolution;unsupervised hyperspectral image superresolution;image spatial resolution;MSI;HR HSI reconstruction accuracy;fusion procedure;shared encoder-decoder structure;nonlinear statistical dependencies;Dirichlet distribution;sum-to-one properties;collaborative l2,1-norm;u2-MDN","","15","","85","IEEE","27 May 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this work, we propose a novel and powerful model for TOWE, Gated Relational target-aware Encoder and local context-aware Decoder (GRED), which dynamically leverages the information of the opinion target and the local context. Intuitively, the target-aware encoder catches the opinion target information, and the local context-aware decoder obtains the local context information from the relationship among surrounding words. Then, GRED employs a gate mechanism to dynamically aggregate the outputs of the encoder and the decoder. In addition, we adopt a pretrained language model Bidirectional and Auto-Regressive Transformer (BART), as the structure of GRED to improve the implicit language knowledge. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets show that GRED surpasses all the baseline models and achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Also, while neural architecture search (NAS) has shown its promise in discovering effective deep architectures in various domains, such as image classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation, contemporary NAS methods are not suitable for anomaly detection due to the lack of intrinsic search space, unstable search process, and low sample efficiency. To bridge the gap, in this article, we propose AutoAD, an automated anomaly detection framework, which aims to search for an optimal neural network model within a predefined search space. Specifically, we first design a curiosity-guided search strategy to overcome the curse of local optimality. A controller, which acts as a search agent, is encouraged to take actions to maximize the information gain about the controller’s internal belief. We further introduce an experience replay mechanism based on self-imitation learning to improve the sample efficiency.

To address these issues, in this paper we propose a novel cross-domain recommendation model based on dual learning that transfers information between two related domains in an iterative manner until the learning process stabilizes. We develop a novel latent orthogonal mapping to extract user preferences over multiple domains while preserving relations between users across different latent spaces. Furthermore, we combine the dual learning method with the metric learning approach, which allows us to significantly reduce the required common user overlap across the two domains and leads to even better cross-domain recommendation performance. We test the proposed model on two large-scale industrial datasets and six domain pairs, demonstrating that it consistently and significantly outperforms all the state-of-the-art baselines.

To this end, we perform abandonment recognition on high-resolution remote sensing images.

The model integrates high-level semantic feature extraction and deep mining of low-level texture features to identify cropland abandonment. First, we labeled the abandoned cropland area and built the high-resolution abandoned cropland (HRAC) dataset, a high-resolution cropland abandonment dataset. Second, we improved PSPNet by fusing statistical texture learning modules to learn multiple texture information on low-level feature maps and combined high-level semantic features for cropland abandonment recognition. Experiments are performed on the HRAC dataset.

Based on the aggregated target-modality image, a cross-modality refinement module is presented to further refine the target-modality image by mining correlative information among the multiple source-modality images and aggregated target-modality image.

Currently, it is a challenging and practically crucial research issue to develop efficient densest subgraphs mining approaches that can handle both very large and continuously evolving graphs. Although large-scale or dynamic methods have been proposed to find the densest subgraphs, there is still a lack of a promising method to deal with large-scale and dynamically evolving graphs. In this paper, the problem is formulated and proved to be NP-Hard, an incremental greedy approximation approach is proposed, and its running time is O(m+n). In order to find the densest subgraph effectively by heuristically merging the local densest subgraphs, firstly, the edge flow of a dynamic graph is divided into several subgraphs in a given period of  $T $ . Secondly, a local candidate set is generated by local denser subgraph discovery. Third, the global densest subgraph candidates are collected by heuristically merging. Last, the densest subgraphs are induced from the global densest subgraph candidates with constraints by static densest subgraph discovery algorithm. This incremental approach enables us to scale up the existing densest subgraph discovery algorithms, which focus mainly on small and static graphs and thus can handle very large dynamic graphs. Experiments on real-world networks with billions of nodes for comprehensive evaluations present excellent improvement in efficiency and accuracy: it reduces about 25% running time on average and presents a more accurate estimation of the structure of a graph with more compact subgraphs than the static method.It also performs well when dealing with graphs of varying densities.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3277197","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10127973","Densest subgraphs;incremental greedy approximation;heuristically merging;local candidate;global densest subgraph candidates","Heuristic algorithms;Approximation algorithms;Greedy algorithms;Social networking (online);Density functional theory;Image edge detection;Data mining","approximation theory;computational complexity;data mining;graph theory;greedy algorithms;optimisation","dynamic graph;global densest subgraph candidates;graph mining tasks;incremental greedy approximation;large dynamic graphs;local denser subgraph discovery;NP-hard problem;static densest subgraph discovery algorithm","","","","56","CCBY","17 May 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To tackle these challenges, we put forth a novel frequency feature pyramid network (FFPNet) in this paper. Our proposed FFPNet extracts the multi-scale information by frequency feature pyramid module, which can tackle the issue of large-scale variations. Meanwhile, the frequency feature pyramid module uses different frequency branches to obtain different scale information. We also adopt the attention mechanism to strength the extraction of different scale information. Moreover, we devise a novel loss function, namely global-local consistency loss, to address the existing problems of imbalanced data distribution and insufficient local patterns. Furthermore, we conduct extensive experiments on six datasets to evaluate our proposed FFPNet.

However, collisions and deadlocks between AGVs are inevitable. Many algorithms have been proposed to solve these problems, but their performance is inefficient in the WIP warehouse due to the lack of consideration of its features. In this paper, to fill the gap between current research and real-world application requirement, we construct a collision and deadlock solving model for a multi-AGV system in a WIP warehouse (CDSMWW). Then we propose a coordination strategy based on dynamic spare point application (DSPA), aiming to improve the efficiency of solving AGV collisions and deadlocks in a WIP warehouse. In this method, the AGV records its predecessor, successor, and reserved points in its local controller and can only enter the set of sequential shared points if its application for spare points is successful. Otherwise, it has to stop to avoid causing an unresolvable deadlock. If a deadlock occurs while this AGV is in the sequential shared points, the AGV moves to the spare point to resolve it. Whenever an AGV leaves the set of consecutive shared points, it releases all its spare points. We apply the algorithm to both the central and local controllers to improve the calculation efficiency.

However, there exist so-called semantic gaps among different kinds of buildings due to the large intraclass variance of buildings, and most of the present-day methods are ineffective in extracting various buildings in large areas that cover different scenes, for example, urban villages and high-rise buildings, because existing building extraction strategies are the same for various scenes. With the improvement of the resolution of remote sensing images, it is feasible to improve the image interpretation based on the scene prior. However, this idea has not been fully utilized in building extraction from VHR remote sensing imagery. This study proposes a scene-driven multitask parallel attention convolutional network (MTPA-Net) to resolve these limitations. The proposed approach classifies the input image into multilabel scenes and further separately maps the buildings in pixel level under different scenes. In addition, a simple postprocessing method is applied to integrate the building extraction results and scene prior. Our proposed method does not require multimodel training and the network can learn in an end-to-end manner. The performance of our proposed method is evaluated on a data set that includes various urban and rural scenes with diverse landscapes.

However, the utilization of optical remote sensing data suffers from the limitation of bad weather and cloud contamination. To address aforementioned issue and enhance spatial details of polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (PolSAR) image, a novel dual-domain super-resolution image fusion method is proposed by combining improved spherically invariant random vector (ISIRV) model with generalized adaptive linear combination approximation (GALCA) technology in this study. The proposed method decomposes the task of image fusion into polarimetric and texture domain fusion by integrating polarimetric components of PolSAR image and texture detail component of panchromatic image, which can significantly improve spatial resolutions of the PolSAR image while preserving polarimetric information. The data fusion experiment is implemented with three data sets including panchromatic images of Gaofen-1 (GF-1) and Gaofen-2 (GF-2) and the quad-pol SAR data of Gaofen-3 (GF-3) and Radarsat-2. Results show that the proposed dual-domain image fusion method provides a better performance compared with state-of-the-art multisensor fusion methods (BT, PCA, GS, indusion, and PRACS) regarding qualitative and quantitative evaluations.

Echo state network (ESN) is frequently employed in the realm of chaotic time series modeling and prediction, but the basic ESN has been proved to have an antagonistic tradeoff between nonlinear transformation and memory capacity. To overcome this tradeoff, a new architecture named hierarchical ESN with augmented random features (HESN-ARF) is proposed. On the basis of the traditional linear random projection, the proposed HESN-ARF further leverages nonlinear kernel transformation to construct augmented random features, which can enable the linear and nonlinear properties to be fully represented. Moreover, the HESN-ARF utilizes low-rank kernel approximation to further reduce the computational cost, preserving the advantage of efficient modeling as much as possible while ensuring the capacities of nonlinear transformation and dynamical memory simultaneously.

Most recent works show that visual information can boost the NER performance since images can provide complementary contextual information for texts. However, the image-level features ignore the mapping relations between fine-grained visual objects and textual entities, which results in error detection in entities with different types. To better exploit visual and textual information in NER, we propose an adversarial gated bilinear attention neural network (AGBAN). The model jointly extracts entity-related features from both visual objects and texts, and leverages an adversarial training to map two different representations into a shared representation. As a result, domain information contained in an image can be transferred and applied for extracting named entities in the text associated with the image. Experimental results on Tweets dataset demonstrate that our model outperforms the state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, we systematically evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed gated bilinear attention network in capturing the interactions of mutimodal features visual objects and textual words.

This article proposes FTS, which is a novel model for faceted text segmentation via multitask learning (MTL). FTS models faceted text segmentation as an MTL problem with text segmentation and facet annotation. This model employs the bidirectional long short-term memory (Bi-LSTM) network to learn the feature representation of sentences within a document. The feature representation is shared and adjusted with common parameters by MTL, which can help an optimization model to learn a better-shared and robust feature representation from text segmentation to facet annotation. Moreover, the text segmentation is modeled as a sequence tagging task using LSTM with a conditional random fields (CRFs) classification layer. Extensive experiments are conducted on five data sets from five domains: data structure, data mining, computer network, solid mechanics, and crystallography.

First, the curse of dimensionality degrades the performance of many practical data processing techniques. Second, due to the existence of noise and outliers, feature extraction on corrupted data cannot be effectively achieved. Recently, some representation based methods have produced promising results. However, these methods cannot handle the case in which nonlinear similarity exists and have failed to provide the quantized interpretability for the importance of features. In this paper, we propose a novel low rank and sparse representation method to realize dimensionality reduction and robustly extract latent low dimensional discriminative features. Specifically, we first adopt multiple kernel learning to map the original data into an embedded reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) and then kernel based similarity discriminative projection is learned to explore the within-class and between-class variability. Notably, this low dimensional feature learning strategy is definitely integrated into the low rank matrix recovery of the kernel matrix. Next, we introduce the regularization of  $l_{2,1}$  norm on error matrix to eliminate noise and on projection matrix to lead the selected features to be more compact and interpretable. The non-convex optimization problem is effectively solved by the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) methods.

Moreover, for the lack of multiscale features extraction and fusion, they are difficult to extract different scale farmland parcels accurately. Based on these issues, we propose a fuzzy-boundary enhanced trident network, named FBETNet, to enhance the feature of fuzzy boundary and generate multiscale parcels. First, a semantic-guided multitask strategy is introduced in order to enhance the feature of fuzzy boundary.

To address the issue, we propose a unique multiple instance graph (MIG) learning framework for WSOD in RSIs. The motivation of this work is twofold: 1) a spatial graph-based vote (SGV) mechanism is proposed to find high-quality objects by collecting the top-ranking votes with highly spatial overlap and 2) an appearance graph-based instance mining (AGIM) model is further constructed to exploit all possible instances with the same class by propagating the label information according to the apparent similarity. It is noted that the formulated MIG framework that collaborates SGV and AGIM is independent of extra hyperparameters or annotations.

Simultaneously, different tasks often need to be modeled separately. Domain adaptation, as one of the research contents of transfer learning, has certain advantages in solving the problem of inconsistent feature distribution. This article designs and establishes a domain adaptation framework based on multiscale mixed domain feature (DA-MMDF) for cross-domain intelligent fault diagnosis of rolling bearings under polytropic working conditions. The proposed method first uses the MMDF extractor to obtain features from the collected data, which constructs a complete feature space through variational mode decomposition (VMD) and mixed domain feature extraction to fully mine the state information and intrinsic attributes of the vibration signal. Second, the dimensionality reduction and optimization of features are achieved through extreme gradient promotion, and meaningful and sensitive features are selected according to the importance of features to eliminate redundant information. The optimized important features are combined with the manifold embedded distribution alignment method to realize the distribution alignment of data in different fields and cross-domain diagnosis. In order to verify the effectiveness of the proposed approach, the rolling bearing data sets gathered from the laboratories are employed and analyzed. The analysis result confirms that DA-MMDF is able to achieve effective transfer diagnosis between polytropic working conditions.

In this paper, we propose a novel multimodal representation learning model for social images, that is, correlational multimodal variational autoencoder (CMVAE) via triplet network. Specifically, in order to mine the highly nonlinear correlation between the visual content and the textual content, a CMVAE is proposed to learn a unified representation for the multiple modalities of social images. Both common information in all modalities and private information in each modality are encoded for the representation learning. To incorporate the social relations among images, we employ the triplet network to embed multiple types of social links in the representation learning. Then, a joint embedding model is proposed to combine the social relations for representation learning of the multimodal contents. Comprehensive experiment results on four datasets confirm the effectiveness of our method in two tasks, namely, multilabel classification and cross-modal retrieval.

However, CNNs are computationally expensive, making them unfavorable for resource-limited devices with real-time constraints. Recent advances in neural architectures search (NAS) promise opportunities in automated optimization for disparity estimation. However, the main challenge of the NAS methods is the significant amount of computing time to explore a vast search space [e.g.,  $1.6\times 10^{29}$ ] and costly training candidates. To reduce the NAS computational demand, many proxy-based NAS methods have been proposed. Despite their success, most of them are designed for comparatively small-scale learning tasks. In this article, we propose a fast NAS method, called FastStereoNet, to enable resource-aware NAS within an intractably large search space. FastStereoNet automatically searches for hardware-friendly CNN architectures based on late acceptance hill climbing (LAHC), followed by simulated annealing (SA). FastStereoNet also employs a fine-tuning with a transferred weights mechanism to improve the convergence of the search process. The collection of these ideas provides competitive results in terms of search time and strikes a balance between accuracy and efficiency. Compared to the state of the art, FastStereoNet provides  $5.25\times $  reduction in search time and  $44.4\times $  reduction in model size. These benefits are attained while yielding a comparable accuracy that enables seamless deployment of disparity estimation on resource-limited devices.

Deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) provide a favoured prospect for automatic polyp segmentation and evade the limitations of visual inspection, e.g., subjectivity and overwork. However, most existing CNNs-based methods often provide unsatisfactory segmentation performance. In this paper, we propose a novel boundary constraint network, namely BCNet, for accurate polyp segmentation. The success of BCNet benefits from integrating cross-level context information and leveraging edge information. Specifically, to avoid the drawbacks caused by simple feature addition or concentration, BCNet applies a cross-layer feature integration strategy (CFIS) in fusing the features of the top-three highest layers, yielding a better performance. CFIS consists of three attention-driven cross-layer feature interaction modules (ACFIMs) and two global feature integration modules (GFIMs). ACFIM adaptively fuses the context information of the top-three highest layers via the self-attention mechanism instead of direct addition or concentration. GFIM integrates the fused information across layers with the guidance from global attention. To obtain accurate boundaries, BCNet introduces a bilateral boundary extraction module that explores the polyp and non-polyp information of the shallow layer collaboratively based on the high-level location information and boundary supervision. Through joint supervision of the polyp area and boundary, BCNet is able to get more accurate polyp masks.

However, most of the traditional semisupervised neural network detection frameworks are complex to train and require additional structural analysis, along with a fixed structure, lacking universality. In this article, a semisupervised adaptive ladder network (SSALN) for remote sensing image CD is proposed, which enables dual-input label-incremental architecture searching with a concise and variable structure. First, SSALN is suitable for CD from two remote sensing images of any type with the characteristic of minimal label dependency and automatic network structure adjustment. The network can generate more reliable pseudolabels through continuous iterations to help limited real labels exploit implicit information, identify the most effective network, and form the ascending network structure optimization. Second, the acquisition of pseudolabels is the fusion of semisupervised and unsupervised CD approaches, which ensures the multiperspective information supplement. Multiple CD maps are fused to generate labels for the next iteration, making the predicting more reliable. Finally, both homogenous images and heterogenous images are tested with experiments. Even if the detection object is switched, it can be well adaptive and compatible without manual modification of the network. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can promote the flow of label information through structure searching and self-circulation in the ascending network optimization; thus, it has outstanding performance on tasks of remote sensing image CD.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2022.3158741","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62076204); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9732943","Adaptive structure;change detection (CD);genetic algorithm;remote sensing image;semisupervised network","Remote sensing;Training;Task analysis;Feature extraction;Neural networks;Data mining;Adaptive systems","geophysical image processing;neural nets;optimisation;remote sensing;semi-supervised learning (artificial intelligence)","semisupervised adaptive ladder network;remote sensing image change detection;SSALN;remote sensing image CD;dual-input label-incremental architecture;minimal label dependency;automatic network structure adjustment;ascending network structure optimization;semisupervised CD;unsupervised CD;multiple CD maps;homogenous images;heterogenous images;detection object;structure searching;semisupervised neural network detection","","34","","73","IEEE","10 Mar 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Previous methods either require large-scale manually-annotated data or rely on distant supervision approaches which suffer from the long-tail problem. To reduce the expensive manually-annotating cost and solve the long-tail problem, prototypical networks are widely used in few-shot RC tasks. Despite their remarkable performance, current prototypical networks ignore the different granularities of relations, which degrades the classification performance dramatically. Moreover, the optimization of current prototypical networks simply relies on the cross-entropy loss, which cannot consider the intra-relation compactness and the dispersion among relations in a semantic space. It is not robust enough for the current prototypical network in real-world and complicated scenarios. In this paper, we propose an area prototypical network with a granularity-aware measurement, aiming to consider the different granularities of relations. Each relation is represented as an area whose width can reflect the granularity level of relation.

Existing distributed methods are inefficient in communication. They have to shuffle partial matching results during the distributed multiway join. The partial matching results may be much larger than the data graph itself. To overcome the drawback, we develop the Batch-BENU framework for distributed subgraph enumeration on static data graphs. Batch-BENU executes a group of local search tasks in parallel. Each task enumerates subgraphs around a vertex in the data graph, guided by a backtracking-based execution plan. To handle large-scale data graphs that may exceed the memory capacity of a single machine, Batch-BENU stores the data graph in a distributed database. Each task queries adjacency sets of the data graph on demand, shuffling the data graph instead of partial matching results. To support incremental subgraph enumeration on dynamic data graphs, we propose the Streaming-BENU framework. Streaming-BENU turns the problem of enumerating incremental matching results into enumerating all matching results of incremental pattern graphs at each time step. We implement Batch-BENU and Streaming-BENU with the local database cache and the load balance optimization to improve their efficiency. Extensive experiments show that Batch-BENU and Streaming-BENU can scale to big graphs and complex pattern graphs.

For the trade-off between time and performance, most of methods use the coarse-to-fine hierarchical architecture, which consists of retrieving top-N candidates using global features, and re-ranking top-N with local features. However, since the two types of features are usually processed independently, re-ranking may harm global retrieval, termed re-ranking confusion. Moreover, re-ranking is limited by global retrieval. In this paper, we propose a tightly coupled learning (TCL) strategy to train triplet models. Different from original triplet learning (OTL) strategy, it combines global and local descriptors for joint optimization. In addition, a bidirectional search dynamic time warping (BS-DTW) algorithm is also proposed to mine locally spatial information tailored to VPR in re-ranking. The experimental results on public benchmarks show that the models using TCL outperform the models using OTL, and TCL can be used as a general strategy to improve performance for weakly supervised ranking tasks.

Although machine learning for decision making has been identified as one of the most important applications of AI, up to now, prescriptive analytics is mainly addressed with domain-specific optimization models. On the other hand, existing literature lacks generalized prescriptive analytics models capable of being dynamically adapted according to the human preferences. Reinforcement Learning, as the third machine learning paradigm alongside supervised learning and unsupervised learning, has the potential to deal with the dynamic, uncertain and time-variant environments, the huge states space of sequential decision making processes, as well as the incomplete knowledge.

Most existing studies generally assume the availability of target data during training to guide the domain adaptation process. Actually, this assumption is difficult to hold in many real engineering scenarios, where fault data cannot be obtained in advance. Therefore, how to mine universal and effective diagnosis knowledge only from the source domain and generalize it to unseen target tasks is crucial for further developing intelligent cross-domain fault diagnosis. With this in mind, this article proposes a novel domain transferability-based deep domain generalization (DT-DDG) method. To achieve excellent diagnostic performance on the unseen domain, an adversarial training scheme combining the dynamic weighting strategy and a batch spectral penalization regularization term is elaborated so that the domain-invariant and discriminative features can be extracted from multiple source domains with potential discrepancies, which can hold in new target domain without assuming the available of fault data. Moreover, the network architecture is further optimized to address the category shift problem, thus taking full advantage of more source domains and learn more abundant diagnosis knowledge. On multiple generalization tasks using five datasets, the effectiveness and superiority of the DT-DDG method are validated, and the results show its great promise in actual fault diagnosis scenarios.","1941-0050","","10.1109/TII.2022.3210555","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:51875100,52005267); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(grant numbers:3203002101C3); Jiangsu Planned Projects for Postdoctoral Research Funds(grant numbers:2020Z285); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9905947","Adversarial training;deep domain generalization;fault transfer diagnosis;rotating machinery;unseen target domain","Training;Fault diagnosis;Task analysis;Machinery;Feature extraction;Data models;Informatics","deep learning (artificial intelligence);fault diagnosis;feature extraction;learning (artificial intelligence);vibrational signal processing","abundant diagnosis knowledge;actual fault diagnosis scenarios;cross-domain fault diagnosis problems;developing intelligent cross-domain fault diagnosis;domain adaptation process;domain transferability-based deep domain generalization method;domain-invariant;DT-DDG method;effective diagnosis knowledge;fault data;knowledge transfer strategies;multiple generalization tasks;multiple source domains;source domain;target domain;universal diagnosis knowledge;unseen domain;unseen target tasks","","","","32","IEEE","29 Sep 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this paper, we leverage the power of crowdsourcing by designing a set of Human Intelligence Tasks, or HITs in short, to ask a crowd to improve the quality of uncertain data. In particular, we consider crowds consists of workers with diverse accuracy rates when answering the HITs. We design solutions to maximize the data quality with minimal number of HITs. There are two obstacles for this non-trivial optimization, which lead to very high computational cost for selecting the optimal set of HITs. First, members of a crowd may return incorrect answers with different probabilities. Second, the HITs decomposed from uncertain data are often correlated. We have addressed these challenges in this paper by designing an effective approximation algorithm and an efficient heuristic solution, especially for crowds with diverse individual accuracy rates. To further improve the efficiency, we derive tight lower and upper bounds for effective filtering and estimation.

First, we use the fully attentional pyramid module (FAPM) to enhance the deep feature information of the original image. And we introduce the dense feature fusion module (DFFM) to fully fuse the bitemporal features to obtain the change regions. Second, the introduction of channelwise cross fusion transformer (CCT) and channelwise cross attention (CCA) not only can effectively fuse channel features focusing on different semantic patterns but also bridge the semantic gap between multiscale features. Next, we use the transformer decoder to map the learned high-level semantic information into the pixel space to refine the original features. In addition, we use the context extraction module (CEM) to obtain the local and global associations of feature maps. Finally, the addition of an attention aggregation module (AAM) can effectively combine the feature information at different scales.

It is mainly used to focus on the changing information on the ground over a period of time, and to identify the interested change targets from it. The rapid changes in ground information due to social development undoubtedly increase the importance of change detection. Currently, change detection methods still have some shortcomings in dealing with complex targets, environmental noise, and other aspects. Therefore, we propose a differential feature extraction network based on adaptive frequency transformer for remote sensing change detection (DAFT). Adaptive frequency transformer (AFFormer) is capable of separating change targets and environments from a frequency perspective and capturing long-range dependencies between feature information through self-attention. Therefore, in DAFT, we use AFFormer as the backbone network to extract feature information from bitemporal images, enhancing our focus on change targets while obtaining richer and more detailed information. To our knowledge, this is the first time that AFFormer has been applied in the field of CD. To address the issues of missing location information of change targets and insufficient local feature correlation, DAFT proposes a differential features enhancement module in the feature reconstruction stage of change targets. In addition, DAFT uses DO-Conv to enhance pixel correlation calculation in convolutional operations, allowing the network to focus on richer information. By outputting results at different scales during the feature reconstruction stage, DAFT computes multiple losses that are summed up to guide the training process for better performance. The experimental results prove that DAFT achieves high versus mainstream networks.

Thus, it is difficult for them to make correct choices based on their skills. Generally, existing methods mainly mine isomorphic information, ignoring relationships among heterogeneous information. Therefore, this paper proposes a new framework to give freshmen appropriate recommendations by mining heterogeneous educational information. This framework is composed of five stages: after data preprocessing, a weighted heterogeneous educational network (WHEN) is constructed according to heterogeneous information in student historical data. Then, the WHEN is projected into different subnets, on which metapaths are defined. Next, a WHEN-based embedding method is proposed, which helps mine the weighted heterogeneous information on multiple extended metapaths. Finally, with the information mined, a matrix factorization algorithm is used to recommend learning resources and majors for freshmen. A large number of experimental results show that the proposed framework can achieve better results than other baseline methods. This indicates that the proposed method is effective and can provide great help to freshmen during the COVID-19 storm.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3075675","Major projects of the National Social Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:19ZDA066); New Agricultural and New Engineering Research and Reform Practice Commission Project(grant numbers:2020A1704); Humanity and Social Science Youth Foundation of Ministry of Education of China(grant numbers:20YJC860040); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, Zhongnan University of Economics and Law(grant numbers:2722019PY062); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, Zhongnan University of Economics and Law(grant numbers:2722020JCT034); Application Foundation Frontier Project of Wuhan Science and Technology Bureau in 2020(grant numbers:2020010601012183); Humanities and Social Sciences Planning Project of the China Ministry of Education(grant numbers:19YJAZH099); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, Zhongnan University of Economics and Law(grant numbers:2722021BX025); Hundred years and hundreds items of grassroots party building innovation projects, Zhongnan University of Economics and Law; New Engineering Research and Practice Project of Ministry of Education of China(grant numbers:E-JSJRJ20201330); Ministry of Education’s Collaborative Education Project of Industry University Cooperation; National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:72041005); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9416497","COVID-19;weighted heterogeneous educational network (WHEN);freshman;recommendation;random walk","Data mining;COVID-19;Training;Social networking (online);Task analysis;Collaboration","computer aided instruction;data mining;further education;learning (artificial intelligence);matrix decomposition;recommender systems","weighted heterogeneous information;student historical data;data preprocessing;heterogeneous educational information;freshmen appropriate recommendations;isomorphic information;correct choices;traditional higher education;unprecedented challenges;global explosion;COVID-19 storm;personalized freshmen recommendation;weighted heterogeneous educational network embedding","","3","","45","CCBY","26 Apr 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Machine learning provides a promising technique to optimize EEG patterns toward better decoding accuracy. However, existing algorithms do not effectively explore the underlying data structure capturing the true EEG sample distribution and, hence, can only yield a suboptimal decoding accuracy. To uncover the intrinsic distribution structure of EEG data, we propose a clustering-based multitask feature learning algorithm for improved EEG pattern decoding. Specifically, we perform affinity propagation-based clustering to explore the subclasses (i.e., clusters) in each of the original classes and then assign each subclass a unique label based on a one-versus-all encoding strategy. With the encoded label matrix, we devise a novel multitask learning algorithm by exploiting the subclass relationship to jointly optimize the EEG pattern features from the uncovered subclasses. We then train a linear support vector machine with the optimized features for EEG pattern decoding. Extensive experimental studies are conducted on three EEG data sets to validate the effectiveness of our algorithm in comparison with other state-of-the-art approaches. The improved experimental results demonstrate the outstanding superiority of our algorithm, suggesting its prominent performance for EEG pattern decoding in BCI applications.","2162-2388","","10.1109/TNNLS.2021.3053576","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9349966","Brain–computer interface (BCI);electroencephalogram (EEG);multitask learning;pattern decoding;subclass regularization","Electroencephalography;Decoding;Feature extraction;Task analysis;Optimization;Data mining;Sparse matrices","brain-computer interfaces;electroencephalography;learning (artificial intelligence);medical signal processing;pattern classification;pattern clustering;support vector machines","EEG decoding;accurate electroencephalogram pattern;specific mental tasks;brain-computer interface;considerably low signal-to-noise ratio;brain scalp;machine learning;EEG patterns;underlying data structure;sample distribution;suboptimal decoding accuracy;intrinsic distribution structure;EEG data;clustering-based multitask feature learning algorithm;improved EEG pattern decoding;affinity propagation-based;encoded label matrix;novel multitask learning algorithm;subclass relationship;pattern features;uncovered subclasses;linear support vector machine;optimized features;data sets","Brain-Computer Interfaces;Cluster Analysis;Electroencephalography;Machine Learning;Neural Networks, Computer","10","","77","IEEE","8 Feb 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, the distributed nature of this paradigm makes the application deployment and development process more challenging since the developer must divide the application’s functionality into multiple parts, assigning for each a set of requirements. As a result, the developer must: 1) define the application’s requirements and validate them at design time and 2) find a deployment strategy on the target edge computing platform. In this article, we propose EdgeFlow, a new IoT framework capable of assisting the developer in the application development process. Specifically, we introduce a methodology for latency-sensitive IoT applications development and deployment, consisting of three different stages, i.e., the development, validation, and deployment. To this end, we propose an extension of the flow-based programming paradigm with new timing requirements and provide a resource allocation technique to assist with the deployment and validation of latency-sensitive IoT applications.

Most current approaches employ attention-based neural methods to capture semantic relationships between aspects and words in one sentence. However, these methods ignore the fact that sentences with the same aspect and sentiment polarity often share the structure and semantic information in a domain, which leads to lower model performance. To mitigate this problem, we propose a heterogeneous aspect graph neural network (HAGNN) to learn the structure and semantic knowledge from intersentence relationships. Our model is a heterogeneous graph neural network since it contains three different kinds of nodes: word nodes, aspect nodes, and sentence nodes. These nodes can pass structure and semantic information between each other and update their embeddings to improve the performance of our model. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to use a heterogeneous graph to capture relationships between sentences and aspects.

However, Bitcoin’s erratic behavior has discouraged some potential investors. To get insights into its behavior and price fluctuation, past studies have discovered the correlation between Twitter sentiments and Bitcoin behavior. Most of them have exclusively focused on their relationships, instead of the Twitter sentiment analysis itself. Finding the most suitable classification algorithms for sentiment analysis for this kind of data is challenging. For the enormous data in Twitter, the supervised sentiment analysis approach of unlabeled data can be time-consuming and expensive, which has been studied to be superior to unsupervised ones. As such, we propose the HyVADRF (hybrid valence aware dictionary and sentiment reasoner (VADER)–random forest) and gray wolf optimizer (GWO) model. A semantic and rule-based VADER was used to calculate polarity scores and classify sentiments, which overcame the weakness of manual labeling, while a random forest was utilized as its supervised classifier. Furthermore, considering Twitter’s massive size, we collected over 3.6 million tweets and analyzed various dataset sizes as these are related to the model’s learning process. Lastly, GWO parameter tuning was conducted to optimize the classifier’s performance. The results show that 1) the HyVADRF model had an accuracy of 75.29%, precision of 70.22%, recall of 87.70%, and F1-score of 78%. 2) The most ideal dataset size percentage is 90% of the total collected tweets ( $n =1$ ,249,060). 3) The standard deviations are 0.0008 for accuracy and F1-score and 0.0011 for precision and recall.

To alleviate the aforementioned issues, we propose a regression-based online MOT method. First, an object-aware embedding extraction module (OAEM) is designed to extract preliminary discriminative embedding of the object in the current frame. Then, an embedding aggregation module (EAM) is proposed to obtain high-quality aggregated embedding in temporal. Finally, the temporal embedding combined with the preliminary embedding extracted from the current frame to obtain a refined embedding feature for subsequent position prediction and association. Importantly, we achieve a beneficial interaction between embedding extraction, position prediction and association task. The proposed method does not suffer from significant memory consumption. Therefore, our method is a potential solution for intelligent video analysis on IoT devices. To evaluate the proposed method, we have conducted numerous experiments on the MOT16, MOT17, and MOT20 benchmark data sets.

Sensing-data-driven IoT applications are prevalent in IoT systems, and their task processing relies on sensing data from sensors. Therefore, to ensure the Quality of Service (QoS) of such applications in an edge-enabled IoT system, dedicated caching functions (CFs) are required to cache necessary sensing data. This article considers an edge-enabled IoT system and investigates the joint caching and computing service placement (JCCSP) problem for sensing-data-driven IoT applications. Then, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is exploited to address the problem since it can adapt to a heterogeneous system with limited prior knowledge. In the proposed DRL-based approaches, a policy network based on the encoder–decoder model is constructed to address the issue of varying sizes of JCCSP states and actions caused by different numbers of CFs related to applications. Then, an on-policy REINFORCE-based method is adopted to train the policy network. After that an off-policy training method based on the twin-delayed (TD) deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) is proposed to enhance the training efficiency and experience utilization. In the proposed DDPG-based method, a weight-averaged twin- $Q$ -delayed (WATQD) algorithm is introduced to reduce the bias of  $Q$ -value estimation. Simulation results show that our proposed DRL-based JCCSP approaches can achieve converged performance that is significantly superior to benchmarks.

However, security of IoT devices and data is a major concern. This research work prioritizes the alternatives of security authentication features from studied articles. The multi-objective optimization method based on the ratio analysis (MOORA) is useful in multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) for ranking the alternatives. The statistical aggregation (SA) method has been used to assign weights to security authentication features in comparison to entropy method. In this paper, we identify weights for authentication features using the proposed SA method. Moreover, we evaluate the accuracy rates of the proposed model using entropy method. Finally, we ranked out the alternatives of authentication features using the MOORA approach. In fact, the entropy weight values came against the initial value of the objects in which the accuracy was 15% which is not suitable to this problem while the accuracy of the SA is 85%. Hence, the accuracy improvement is approximately 70 % using the SA method. This method is applicable for finding the weights of the objects based on initial values by MCDM approaches. We study the key security authentication which is the preserving of confidentiality, integrity, and availability that are the prime objectives for security of an IoT device. Furthermore, challenges are preserving the selected attributes through any approach, as discussed in the literature, adds to the complexity of IoT device security.

Instead, the results of accredited performance measurements are used to measure these standards, which are further used as references in the capacity measuring methods employed by industries. Generally, in industries, the capacity of a web application server is defined by OPS, for which no clear transition criterion exists for calculating tpmC using an empirical verification method. Considering secure Unix to Linux (U2L) x86-based server migration, there are no methods to compare and verify the max-jOPS value of Standard Performance Evaluation Corp., which is an industry-recognized performance measurement standard, to the Unix-based benchmark tpmC. In this study, a scenario-based U2L migration was empirically verified by analyzing and comparing pre-to-post with the interpretation of a census statistical system log data, which was conducted on approximately 1.7M households over 21 days with 25,288 maximum concurrent users. We present the correlation through pre-to-post comparison and analysis of U2L for each census statistical system log data by measuring the maximum CPU utilization as U2L migration between heterogeneous CPUs. The correlation is applied to OPS using the tpmC value of TPC-C proportional equation and quantified as a derived conversion ratio of OPS to max-jOPS. Consequently, we formulated and normalized an arithmetic expression, resulting in a CPU core conversion ratio of 0.165 as facile from a Unix-based legacy platform to an x86-based server. Therefore, we propose a new server sizing model for secure U2L migration between heterogeneous CPU architectures, which results in an average of 14.3% improvement in data processing time.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3119397","MSIP (Ministry of Science, ICT, and Future Planning), Korea, under the Human Resource Development Project for Brain Scouting Program and Research on Security of 5G-data-intensive Computing Platforms Based on Disaggregated Architecture(grant numbers:IITP-2017-0-01889,IITP-2020-0-00666); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9567673","Server sizing;capacity planning;Unix to Linux (U2L) migration","Servers;Business;Size measurement;Hardware;Standards;Java;Benchmark testing","Internet;Linux;microprocessor chips;performance evaluation;statistical analysis","quantitative server sizing model;performance satisfaction;OPS;server hardware;accredited performance measurements;Web application server;clear transition criterion;empirical verification method;Linux x86-based server migration;max-jOPS value;industry-recognized performance measurement standard;Unix-based benchmark tpmC;scenario-based U2L migration;census statistical system;pre-to-post comparison;maximum CPU utilization;Unix-based legacy platform;operation per second;microprocessors;capacity measuring methods;standard performance evaluation corp;census statistical system log data;heterogeneous CPUs;arithmetic expression;TPC-C proportional equation","","","","36","CCBYNCND","11 Oct 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Recently, presentation-based approaches have been widely concerned and many feature extraction algorithms based on this have been proposed. However, in the process of acquiring real data, the pollution of complex noise cannot always be avoided, which will greatly increase the difficulty of feature extraction and even lead to failed feature extraction results. Thus, a robust image feature extraction model based on Orthogonal Low-Rank Projection Learning (OLRPL) is proposed, in which the introduction of orthogonal matrix can encourage the preservation of the main components of the sample. Particularly, the row sparsity constraint introduced on the projection matrix can encourage the features to be more compact, discriminative and interpretable. In particular, the Weighted Truncated Schatten p-norm (WTSN) is proposed to better solve the optimization problem of low-rank constraints. At the same time, the correntropy is applied in OLRPL to suppress the complex noise in the data and thus improve the robustness of the model. Finally, we specially design a robust classification loss function so that our model can be fitted the supervised scene effectively. Experiments on five general databases have proved that OLRPL has better effectiveness and robustness than existing advanced methods.","1941-0077","","10.1109/TMM.2021.3109442","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62102331,62176125,61772272); Sichuan Science and Technology Program(grant numbers:2020YJ0432,2019YJ0309); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9535310","Feature extraction;WTSN;low-rank representation;projection learning","Feature extraction;Robustness;Data models;Principal component analysis;Dimensionality reduction;Data mining;Task analysis","entropy;feature extraction;image classification;learning (artificial intelligence);matrix algebra;optimisation","complex noise pollution;robust image feature extraction;OLRPL;orthogonal matrix;projection matrix;low-rank constraints;robust classification loss function;orthogonal low-rank projection learning;optimization;weighted truncated Schatten p-norm;WTSN;correntropy","","3","","46","IEEE","10 Sep 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, there exist two drawbacks: firstly, these methods are mostly designed for vectorial data in Euclidean spaces, which are not suitable for multidimensional data with nonlinear manifold structure, e.g., videos and image-sets. Secondly, the clustering performance heavily relies on the quality of a pre-learned Laplacian matrix in which the global structure may be mis-interpreted without considering manifold structures. In this paper, we firstly provide a unified framework about self-expression learning on Grassmann manifolds, which implements the clustering tasks for multidimensional data under subspace views. Then, to assign optimal neighbors to each data depending on the local distance, we adaptively learn the neighborhood relationship from the obtained self-expression coefficient matrix, referred to Learning Adaptive Neighborhood Graph on Grassmann manifolds (GMAN). In the optimization process, the neighborhood relationship can be adaptively learned and updated with the coefficient matrix.

However, it is difficult to directly apply the supervised model to arbitrary unseen domains due to the domain gap between the available source domains and unseen target domains. In this paper, we propose a novel label distribution learning (LDL) method to address generalizable multi-source person Re-ID task (i.e., there are multiple available source domains, and the testing domain is unseen during training), which aims to explore the relation of different classes and mitigate the domain-shift across different domains so as to improve the discrimination of the model and learn the domain-invariant feature, simultaneously. Specifically, during the training process, we produce the label distribution via the online manner to mine the relation information of different classes, thus it is beneficial for extracting the discriminative feature. Besides, for the label distribution of each class, we further revise it to give more and equal attention to the other domains that the class does not belong to, which can effectively reduce the domain gap across different domains and obtain the domain-invariant feature. Furthermore, we also give the theoretical analysis to demonstrate that the proposed method can effectively deal with the domain-shift issue. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed method and show that the proposed method can outperform the state-of-the-art methods.

In this study, we propose a novel training framework, called Attentive Training, to extend speech enhancement to deal with speech interruptions. Attentive training is based on the observation that, in the real world, multiple talkers very unlikely start speaking at the same time, and therefore, a deep neural network can be trained to create a representation of the first speaker and utilize it to attend to or track that speaker in a multitalker noisy mixture.

However, the existing multi-object trackers are commonly designed for natural scenes without considering the characteristics of remotely sensed data. In addition, most trackers are composed of two independent stages of detection and reidentification (ReID), which means that they cannot be mutually promoted. To this end, we propose an end-to-end online framework, which is called TGraM, for multi-object tracking in satellite videos. It models multi-object tracking as a graph information reasoning procedure from the multitask learning perspective. Specifically, a graph-based spatiotemporal reasoning module is presented to mine the potential high-order correlations between video frames. Furthermore, considering the inconsistency of optimization objectives between detection and ReID, a multitask gradient adversarial learning strategy is designed to regularize each task-specific network. In addition, aiming at the data scarcity in this field, a large-scale and high-resolution Jilin-1 satellite video dataset for multi-object tracking (AIR-MOT) is built for the experiments. Compared with state-of-the-art multi-object trackers, TGraM achieves efficient collaborative learning between detection and ReID, improving the tracking accuracy by 1.2 multiple object tracking accuracy.

However, most existing methods fail to explore the internal spatial structure of data, resulting in low unmixing performance. Moreover, when the algorithm is optimized, the solution is unstable. In this article, a regularizer based on nonlocal tensor similarity is proposed, which can not only fully preserve the global information of HSI but also mine the internal information of data in the spatial domain. HSI is regarded as a 3-D tensor and is directly subjected to endmember extraction and abundance estimation. To fully explore the structural characteristics of data, we simultaneously use the local smoothing and low tensor rank prior of the data to constrain the unmixing model. First, several 4-D tensor groups can be obtained after the nonlocal similarity structure of HSI is learned. Subsequently, a low tensor rank prior is applied to each 4-D tensor, which can fully simulate the nonlocal similarity in the image. In addition, total variation (TV) is also used to explore the local spatial relationship of data, which can generate a smooth abundance map through edge preservation. The optimization is solved by the ADMM algorithm. Experiments on synthetic and real data illustrate the superiority of the proposed method.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2021.3095488","National Key Research and Development Project(grant numbers:2020YFB2103902); National Science Fund for Distinguished Young Scholars(grant numbers:61825603); Key Program of National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61632018); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9511333","Hyperspectral unmixing;low tensor rank;nonlocal similarity;nonnegative tensor factorization (NTF)","Tensors;TV;Hyperspectral imaging;Data models;Task analysis;Optimization;Data mining","geophysical image processing;image representation;matrix decomposition;tensors","global information;HSI;internal information;spatial domain;3D tensor;structural characteristics;unmixing model;nonlocal similarity structure;local spatial relationship;hyperspectral unmixing;nonlocal similarity-regularized low-rank tensor factorization;nonnegative tensor factorization;tensor representation;hyperspectral imagery;information loss;internal spatial structure;low unmixing performance;nonlocal tensor similarity;4D tensor groups;ADMM algorithm","","5","","50","IEEE","11 Aug 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this paper, we propose a new task in this field. This task aims to pre-train a general encoder to extract any facial expression representations without fine-tuning. To tackle this task, we extend the self-supervised contrastive learning to pre-train a general encoder for facial expression analysis. To be specific, given a batch of facial expressions, some positive and negative pairs are firstly constructed based on coarse-grained labels and a FER-specified data augmentation strategy. Secondly, we propose the coarse-contrastive (CRS-CONT) learning, where the features of positive pairs are pulled together, while pushed away from the features of negative pairs. Moreover, one key event is that the excessive constraint on the coarse-grained feature distribution will affect fine-grained FER applications. To address this, a weight vector is designed to control the optimization of the CRS-CONT learning. As a result, a well-trained general encoder with frozen weights could preferably adapt to different facial expressions and realize the linear evaluation on any target datasets. Extensive experiments on both in- the-wild and in- the-lab FER datasets show that our method provides superior or comparable performance against state-of-the-art FER methods, especially on unseen facial expressions and cross-dataset evaluation. We hope that this work will help to reduce the training burden and develop a new solution against the fully-supervised feature learning with fine-grained labels.

This article investigates the transition at the end of a horizontal leader's assignment and the morphostatic or morphogenetic consequences for future assignments, stemming from the “fit” between the horizontal leader's work with the expectations that led to his/her appointment. A realist social theory and transition theory perspective is taken with 30 interviews in eight case companies. A model for transition in balanced leadership is abductively developed. Variables identified are context, conditions, actors, mechanism, criteria, and outcomes. Results explain the nature and change of assignment conditions, as well as the (dis)continuation decisions on horizontal leader roles at the end of their assignment.

In this paper, we propose a novel CAM-based framework with Multi-scale Low-Discriminative Feature Reactivation (mLDFR) for WSOL. The mLDFR framework reactivates the low-discriminative object parts via bottom-up continuous feature maps recalibration and multi-scale object category mapping. Compared with the AL-based methods, our method fully improves the localization power of the network without damaging the classification power and can perform multi-instance localization, which are hard to achieve under the AL-based framework. Moreover, the mLDFR framework is flexible, and can be built on the top of various classical CNN backbones. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our method.

The proposed IRU-Net achieved an average F-1 accuracy of 92.34% for the Massachusetts dataset and 95.65% for the AIRS dataset. When compared to other state-of-the-art deep learning-based models such as SegNet, U-Net, E-Net, ERFNet and SRI-Net, the overall accuracy improvements of our IRU-Net model is 9.0% (0.9725 vs. 0.8842), 5.2% (0.9725 vs. 0.9218), 3.0% (0.9725 vs. 0.9428), 1.4% (0.9725 vs. 0.9588) and 0.93% (0.9725 vs. 0.9635), for AIRS dataset and 11.6%, 5.9%, 3.1%, 2.7% and 1.4%, for Massachusetts building dataset.

Evidence of such behavior has been documented across almost all domains of DSE, including ridesharing, lodging, and freelancing. However, little is known about the underlying design decisions of DSE platforms which allow certain demographics of the market to gain unfair advantage over others. To bridge this knowledge gap, in this paper, we systematically synthesize evidence from 58 interdisciplinary studies to identify the pervasive discrimination concerns affecting DSE platforms along with their triggering features and mitigation strategies. Our objective is to consolidate such interdisciplinary evidence from a software design point of view. Our results show that existing evidence is mainly geared towards documenting and mitigating issues of racism and sexism affecting platforms of ridesharing, lodging, and freelancing.

Although many SOD methods for RSIs have been proposed, there are still some problems, such as insufficient feature extraction, relatively worse detection results for tiny objects, and serious interference by background clutter and lighting shadows. In this article, we propose a novel multiscale feature enhancement network (MFENet) for SOD in optical RSIs. Specifically, MFENet first uses the global feature perception (GFP) module to extract the multiscale and global feature information of salient object regions. Second, the global features are enhanced from the channel and spatial dimensions by using the mixed feature enhancement (MFE) module. Third, the semantic feature guidance (SFG) module is constructed to guide the model to obtain fine-grained semantic feature information. Finally, the boundary optimization module (BOM) is designed to refine the boundary features and obtain accurate saliency detection results. To evaluate the performance of MFENet, extensive experiments are conducted on the publicly available ORSSD, EORSSD, and ORSI-4199 datasets. The quantitative and qualitative results show that our method outperforms the existing state-of-the-art SOD methods in several evaluation metrics and exhibits better inference speed (FPS) and calculation parameters.

In this article, we propose an efficient and general algorithm, which is called local affine preservation (LAP) matching, for robust feature matching of remote sensing images. We start by constructing the putative point correspondences according to the similarity of well-designed feature descriptors and then focus on removing false matches from the putative set. The key idea of LAP is to search motion-consistent neighborhoods and maintain the local neighborhood topological structures of the true putative matches. To this end, we present a local geometric constraint, which exploits the property of affine invariance to measure the preservation degree of neighborhood topology, since the property is still held under both rigid and complex nonrigid transformations for a minimum topological unit. Moreover, in order to avoid the random distribution of outliers to destroy the neighborhood structure preservation of inliers, a neighbor mining strategy is introduced to search motion-consistent neighbors for each correspondence. We formulate the problem into an optimization model and derive a closed-form solution with linearithmic time complexity. Extensive experimental results on remote sensing images demonstrate that our LAP is able to achieve better performance over the current state-of-the-art approaches.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2021.3128292","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61773295); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9615050","Affine invariance;feature matching;locality preservation;mismatch removal;motion consistency","Remote sensing;Feature extraction;Reliability;Topology;Task analysis;Parametric statistics;Image matching","computational complexity;computational geometry;data mining;feature extraction;geophysical image processing;image matching;image registration;photogrammetry;remote sensing;transforms","remote sensing images;putative point;well-designed feature descriptors;false matches;putative set;LAP;motion-consistent neighborhoods;local neighborhood topological structures;putative matches;local geometric constraint;affine invariance;preservation degree;neighborhood topology;motion-consistent neighbors;motion consistency;fundamental task;photogrammetry;feature matching endeavors;reliable correspondences;feature points;image pair;local affine preservation matching;robust feature matching","","4","","46","IEEE","15 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

An extensive set of experiments highlights that MTFC constantly outperforms the two baselines Caffe and Theano for all measured metrics across all system configurations, while offering the same level of classification accuracy.

While attempts are being made to make primary diagnosis more reliable and accessible in places with high tuberculosis rates, Chest X-rays has become a popular source. However, specialist radiologists are required for the screening process, which could be a challenge in developing countries. For early diagnosis of tuberculosis utilizing CXR images, a complete automatic system of tuberculosis detection can decrease the need for trained staff. Various deep learning and machine learning technologies have been introduced in recent years for examining digital chest radiographs for TB-related variances with the goal of reducing inter-class reader variability and reproducibility, as well as providing radiologic services in areas where radiologists are not available. Tuberculosis is sometimes misclassified as other conditions with similar radiographic patterns as a result of CXR images, resulting in inefficient therapy. The current approach, however, is limited to Computer-Aided Detection (CAD), which has only been evaluated with non-deep learning models. Deep neural networks open potentially new avenues for tuberculosis treatment. There are no peer-reviewed studies comparing the effectiveness of various deep learning systems in detecting TB anomalies, and none compare multiple deep learning systems with human readers. In this paper, the aim of the proposed method is to develop an efficient tuberculosis detection system based on stochastic learning with artificial neural network (ANN) model by random variations using Chest X-ray images. This approach can able to incorporate random functions into the network, either by assigning stochastic transfer functions to the network or by assigning stochastic weights to the network. This proposed method is to learn features from CXR images and optimize the parameters of an ANN model by randomly mixing the training dataset before each iteration, resulting in varied ordering of model parameter updates. Furthermore, in a neural network, model weights are frequently initialized at a random beginning point. By focusing on randomness functions with optimization, the proposed technique achieved great accuracy. The motivation of the proposed method is to detect abnormalities in CXR with the different levels of complexity of TB by strong or weak evidence with different deep geometric contexts such as shape, size, cavitation, and density. ANN’s primary benefit is extracting hidden linear and non-linear inter-relationships of high-dimensional and complex data. The proposed method was systematically tested with the Shenzhen and Montgomery datasets using metrics such as sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy, and it was discovered that the proposed method attained better accuracy when compared to state-of-the-art methods. The proposed method shows an improved efficiency with sensitivity of 96.12%, specificity of 98.01%, accuracy 98.45% and F-Score 95.88% respectively.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3208882","Princess Nourah bint Abdulrahman University Researchers Supporting Project(grant numbers:PNURSP2022R79); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9900305","Artificial neural network (ANN);chest X-ray;computer-ided detection (CAD);deep learning;stochastic learning;tuberculosis (TB)","Tuberculosis;Solid modeling;Deep learning;Stochastic processes;X-ray imaging;Lung;Biomedical imaging;Artificial neural networks","backpropagation;deep learning (artificial intelligence);diagnostic radiography;diseases;feature extraction;image classification;learning (artificial intelligence);lung;medical image processing;radiology","radiographic patterns;CXR images;computer-aided detection;nondeep learning models;deep neural networks;tuberculosis treatment;deep learning systems;random variations;chest X-ray images;random functions;stochastic transfer functions;stochastic weights;ANN model;random beginning point;randomness functions;high-dimensional data;stochastic learning-based artificial neural network model;automatic tuberculosis Detection system;primary diagnosis;Chest X-rays;automatic system;trained staff;machine learning technologies;digital chest radiographs;TB-related variances;tuberculosis rates;high-fatality rate;tuberculosis detection system","","","","38","CCBY","22 Sep 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

It enforces that positive pairs become close while negative pairs become far. Contrastive learning utilizes the relative proximity or distance between positive and negative pairs. However, contrastive learning might fail to handle the easily distinguished positive-negative pairs because the gradient of easily divided positive-negative pairs comes to vanish. To overcome the problem, we propose a dynamic mixed margin (DMM) loss that generates the augmented hard positive-negative pairs that are not easily clarified. DMM generates hard positive-negative pairs by interpolating the dataset with Mixup. Besides, DMM adopts the dynamic margin incorporating the interpolation ratio, and dynamic adaptation improves representation learning. DMM encourages making close for positive pairs far away, whereas making a little far for strongly nearby positive pairs alleviates overfitting. Our proposed DMM is a plug-and-play module compatible with diverse contrastive learning loss and metric learning. We validate that the DMM is superior to other baselines on various tasks, video-text retrieval, and recommender system task in unimodal and multimodal settings. Besides, representation learned from DMM shows better robustness even if the modality missing occurs that frequently appears on the real-world dataset.

In this paper, to better align image and language domains in diverse and unrestricted cases, we propose a novel neural network model that performs global reasoning on a dependency tree parsed from the question; thus, our model is called a parse-tree-guided reasoning network (PTGRN). This network consists of three collaborative modules: i) an attention module that exploits the local visual evidence of each word parsed from the question, ii) a gated residual composition module that composes the previously mined evidence, and iii) a parse-tree-guided propagation module that passes the mined evidence along the parse tree. Thus, PTGRN is capable of building an interpretable visual question answering (VQA) system that gradually derives image cues following question-driven parse-tree reasoning.

In recent years, with the development of deep learning, CD methods based on deep learning have achieved good results in the field of CD. However, most current CD methods use single- or dual-stream networks to extract change features, which is insufficient to extract and learn bitemporal change information thoroughly. This article proposes a triple-stream network (TSNet) with cross-stage feature fusion for CD in high-resolution bitemporal remote sensing images. First, to obtain highly representative deep features in the original image, we perform feature extraction on bitemporal remote sensing images and their concatenated image with a dual-stream encoder and a single-stream encoder, respectively. Then, the bitemporal multiscale features extracted by the dual-stream encoder are input into a multistage bidirectional convolutional gated recurrent unit (MSBC_GRU) feature fusion module, allowing the network to learn the change information in a cross-stage manner. In addition, we use a dual-channel attention module to fuse the features extracted by dual- and single-stream encoders, improving the network’s ability to discriminate changed features. The effectiveness of TSNet is demonstrated with three publicly available CD datasets. The extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves the state-of-the-art CD performance on the above three datasets.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2022.3233849","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:42071407); China High-Resolution Earth Observation System(grant numbers:03-Y30F03-9001-20/22); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10005110","Attention mechanism;change detection (CD);high-resolution images;recurrent neural network (RNN);remote sensing","Feature extraction;Remote sensing;Data mining;Classification algorithms;Task analysis;Change detection algorithms;Clustering algorithms","feature extraction;geophysical image processing;image classification;image fusion;image representation;image resolution;land cover;learning (artificial intelligence);remote sensing","bitemporal change information;bitemporal multiscale features;change features;changed features;concatenated image;cross-stage feature fusion;cross-stage manner;current CD methods;deep learning;dual-channel attention module;dual-stream encoder;dual-stream networks;feature extraction;fusion module;high-resolution bitemporal remote sensing images;high-resolution image change detection;high-resolution remote sensing images;highly representative deep features;important topic;land cover changes;multistage bidirectional convolutional gated recurrent unit;publicly available CD datasets;remote sensing field;single-stream encoder;state-of-the-art CD performance;triple-stream network","","","","90","IEEE","3 Jan 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

It is essential for prognosis and early diagnosis for various cardiac diseases. However, the complex motion procedure of the myocardium and the invisible pattern differences pose great challenges, leading to low performance for automatic methods. Most existing works mitigate the task by differentiating the normal motion patterns from the abnormal ones, without fine-grained motion scoring. We propose an effective method for the task of cardiac motion scoring by connecting a bottom-up and another top-down branch with a novel motion-based spatial attention module in multi-scale space. Specifically, we use the convolution blocks for low-level feature extraction that acts as a bottom-up mechanism, and the task of optical flow for explicit motion extraction that acts as a top-down mechanism for high-level allocation of spatial attention. To this end, a newly designed Multi-scale Motion-based Spatial Attention (MMSA) module is used as the pivot connecting the bottom-up part and the top-down part, and adaptively weight the low-level features according to the motion information. Experimental results on a newly constructed dataset of 1440 myocardium segments from 90 subjects demonstrate that the proposed MMSA can accurately analyze the regional myocardium motion, with accuracies of 79.3% for 4-way motion scoring, 89.0% for abnormality detection, and correlation of 0.943 for estimation of motion score index.

Among various de-identification (anonymization) techniques,  $k$ -anonymous microaggregation has been widely studied since it enables us to balance between confidentiality and data utility. Despite plenty of microaggregation methods in the sense of reducing the information loss and/or computational complexity, machine learning (ML) models using the resulting aggregated data face the problem that they are not as effective as expected. Motivated by the fact that ML models can be heavily influenced by distorted training data (albeit slightly), we deliberate on the performance of microaggregation in terms of not only data privacy but also data utility. In this paper, we propose Util-MA, a new utility-embraced microaggregation framework for effective ML applications. Specifically, unlike prior studies that apply microaggregation techniques directly to raw data, we design a unified framework that can potentially enhance the data utility while preserving the  $k$ -anonymity through preprocessing steps including dimensionality reduction and clustering. By using real-world datasets, we empirically demonstrate the superiority of Util-MA over benchmark microaggregation methods in terms of classification accuracy. Moreover, we investigate the importance of preprocessing by measuring key performance indicators (KPIs) of clustering; the clustering stage of Util-MA leads to high performance on the classification when the clustering results substantially coincide with the ground truth labels. We also establish a close relationship between the KPIs of clustering and the classification accuracies, which tends to be revealed when there is a gain of Util-MA over the benchmark method is observed. Our framework is microaggregation-model-agnostic; thus, underlying microaggregation models can be appropriately chosen according to one’s needs and ML tasks.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3183201","National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) Grant by the Korean Government through MSIT(grant numbers:2021R1A2C3004345); Institute of Information and Communications Technology Planning and Evaluation (IITP) Grant by the Korean Government through MSIT (6G Post-MAC—POsitioning and Spectrum-Aware intelligenT MAC for Computing and Communication Convergence)(grant numbers:2021-0-00347); Yonsei University Research Fund of 2021(grant numbers:2021-22-0083); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9796546","Clustering;data utility;dimensionality reduction;k-anonymity;microaggregation","Data models;Data privacy;Computational modeling;Benchmark testing;Task analysis;Dimensionality reduction;Business","computational complexity;data privacy;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;pattern clustering;security of data","data utility;Util-MA;benchmark microaggregation methods;microaggregation-model-agnostic;underlying microaggregation models;machine learning applications;de-identification techniques;k-anonymous microaggregation;machine learning models;resulting aggregated data;ML models;distorted training data;data privacy;utility-embraced microaggregation framework;effective ML applications;microaggregation techniques;raw data","","","","59","CCBY","15 Jun 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Nevertheless, with the increasing adoption and presence of IoT services, it becomes more difficult to find the appropriate IoT service compositions that can maximize the service utility of all the users' requests. Moreover, the IoT devices are usually resource constrained and cannot effectively finish some complex task of service requests, thereby reducing the service quality. To address this problem, we develop a novel IoT service allocation mechanism in collaborative device-edge-cloud architecture. First, prevalence of frequent function interaction is mined to help construct IoT service allocation index. Second, service requests' priority and their preferences towards branch nodes are further set and estimated to help maximize the service composition utility of multiple user requests.

To alleviate these issues, we first introduce a deep hierarchical layer aggregation (DHLA) strategy, which utilizes a block-based layer aggregation to aggregate representations from different layers and transfers the output of the previous block to the subsequent block, so that deeper MPNNs can be easily trained. Additionally, to stabilize the training process, we also develop a novel normalization strategy, neighbor normalization (NeighborNorm), which normalizes the neighbor of each node to further address the training issue in deep MPNNs. Our analysis reveals that NeighborNorm can smooth the gradient of the loss function, i.e., adding NeighborNorm makes the optimization landscape much easier to navigate.

Namely, they perform poorly for multidimensional sparse data. A straightforward solution is to create forests of decision trees with oblique splits; however, most training approaches have low performance. Besides, those ensembles appear unstable and easily overfit, so they should be regularized to find the trade-off between complexity and generalization. This paper proposes an algorithm to train kernel decision trees and random forests. At the top level, this algorithm follows a common greedy procedure to train decision trees; however, it produces quasi-optimal oblique and kernel splits at the decision stump level. At each stump, the algorithm finds a quasi-optimal distribution of classes to subtrees and trains this stump via optimization of an SVM-like loss function with a margin re-scaling approach, which helps optimize the margin between subtree data and arbitrary impurity criteria. We also try to reveal uniform stability-based generalization bounds for those forests and apply them to select the regularization technique. The obtained bounds explicitly consider primary hyperparameters of forests, trees, and decision stumps. The bounds also show a relationship between outliers in decision tree structure, stability and generalization, and illustrate how forests smooth these outliers. We performed an experimental evaluation on several tasks, such as studying the reaction of social media users, image recognition, and bank scoring. The experiments show that the proposed algorithm trains ensembles, which outperform other oblique or kernel forests in many commonly-recognized datasets. Namely, the proposed algorithm shows 99.1% accuracy on MNIST and 58.1% on CIFAR-10. It has been confirmed that the selected regularization technique helps reduce overfitting on several datasets. Therefore, the proposed algorithm may be considered a small step toward customized and regularized ensembles of kernel trees that keep reasonable training performance on large datasets. We believe that the proposed algorithm can be utilized as a construction element of approaches to training context-aware models on complex problems with integer inputs and outputs, such as text mining and image recognition.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3193385","Ministry of Science and Higher Education of the Russian Federation(grant numbers:075-15-2020-799); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9837906","Generalization bounds;kernel splits;kernel forests;random forests;random uniform stability;regularization;slack re-scaling","Kernel;Random forests;Training;Decision trees;Forestry;Stability criteria;Task analysis","data mining;decision trees;greedy algorithms;image recognition;learning (artificial intelligence);optimisation;pattern classification;support vector machines;trees (mathematics)","subtree data;uniform stability-based generalization bounds;decision stumps;algorithm trains ensembles;selected regularization technique;customized regularized ensembles;kernel trees;reasonable training performance;training context-aware models;random kernel forests;random forests;axis-parallel decision trees;competitive accuracy;multidimensional sparse data;oblique splits;training approaches;trade-off between complexity;kernel decision trees;common greedy procedure;decision stump level;subtrees","","1","","46","CCBY","25 Jul 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Recently, the adoption of deep learning techniques has gained significant performance improvement. However, most existing studies focused on exploiting the spatial information of gait data (using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)) while the temporal part received little attention. In this study, we propose a new multi-model Long Short-term Memory (LSTM) network for learning the gait temporal features. First, we observe that LSTM is able to capture the pattern hidden inside the gait data sequences that are out-of-synchronization. Thus, instead of using the gait cycle-based segment, our model accepts the gait cycle-free segment (i.e., fixed-length window) as the input. By this, the classification task does not depend on the gait cycle detection task, which usually suffers from noise and bias. Second, we propose a new LSTM network architecture, in which, one LSTM is used for each gait data channel and a group of consecutive signals is processed in each step. This strategy allows the network to effectively handle the long input data sequence and achieve improved performance compared to existing LSTM-based gait models. In addition, besides using the LSTM alone, we extend it by combining with a CNN model to construct a hybrid network, which further improves the recognition performance. We evaluated our LSTM and hybrid networks under different settings using the whuGAIT and OU-ISIR datasets. The experiments showed that our LSTM network outperformed the existing LSTM networks, and its combination with CNN established new state-of-the-art performance on both the verification and identification tasks.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3056880","Institute of Information & Communications Technology Planning & Evaluation (IITP) grant by the Korean Government, Ministry of Science and ICT (MSIT) (Research on AI-Based Cryptanalysis and Security Evaluation)(grant numbers:2020-0-00126); Vietnam National University (VNU-HCM)(grant numbers:NCM2019-18-01); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9345743","Gait authentication;gait recognition;wearable sensor data;recurrent neural network;LSTM network","Gait recognition;Task analysis;Feature extraction;Gyroscopes;Legged locomotion;Data mining;Computer vision","convolutional neural nets;deep learning (artificial intelligence);feature extraction;gait analysis;image motion analysis;image segmentation;object recognition;recurrent neural nets","gait recognition;window-based data segment;user recognition;deep learning techniques;convolutional neural network;gait temporal features;gait data sequences;gait cycle-based segment;gait cycle-free segment;gait cycle detection task;LSTM network architecture;gait data channel;long input data sequence;CNN model;LSTM networks;LSTM-based gait models;multimodel long short-term memory network;inertial measurement units-based gait analysis;whuGAIT dataset;OU-ISIR dataset","","18","","44","CCBYNCND","3 Feb 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Band selection (BS) is an effective measure to reduce the information redundancy with the physics spectrum preserved for HSI. Although the existing BS methods have achieved noticeable progress, the correlation between neighbor bands still needs to be mined deeply for an effective selection criterion. This article proposes a BS approach to collecting the discriminative band subset for HSI classification (HSIC), which adopts the self-supervised learning paradigm to implement the BS by the auxiliary spectrum rebuilding (SR) task. In specific, we utilized a convolutional neural network (CNN) and a graph convolutional network (GCN) for the spectral–spatial feature extraction. Next, GCN and CNN are developed for the refinement of the band correlation sequentially. Afterward, the selected bands in terms of the acquired correlation are fed into the presented self-supervised SR network for spectral reconstruction. Simultaneously, the proposed architecture completed the selection with the optimization of the band reconstruction by a defined loss function. In this way, we supply substitution for selection criterion and path searching through the end-to-end framework. The extensive experimental results and analysis demonstrated that the proposed hybrid architecture provided a competitive band subset for the classification, and the accuracies with different types of classifiers are more effective than the compared BS methods.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2022.3179513","Science Foundation of Liaoning Province through the Surface Project(grant numbers:LJKZ0065); National Nature Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61971082); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(grant numbers:3132017124); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9785994","Band selection (BS);convolutional neural network (CNN);graph convolutional network (GCN);hyperspectral image classification (HSIC);spectrum rebuilding (SR)","Correlation;Hyperspectral imaging;Convolutional neural networks;Task analysis;Redundancy;Image reconstruction;Convolution","convolutional neural nets;feature extraction;geophysical image processing;hyperspectral imaging;image classification;object detection;supervised learning","correlated bands;calculation consumption;dimension disaster problem;information redundancy;physics spectrum;BS methods;neighbor bands;selection criterion;discriminative band subset;HSI classification;self-supervised learning paradigm;auxiliary spectrum rebuilding task;convolutional neural network;CNN;spectral-spatial feature extraction;band correlation;acquired correlation;self-supervised SR network;spectral reconstruction;band reconstruction;hybrid architecture;competitive band subset;compared BS methods;unsupervised hyperspectral band selection;hybrid graph convolutional network;hyperspectral image;substantial number","","2","","50","IEEE","1 Jun 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Due to the lack of labeled data and the poor generalization ability of supervised models, cross-scene classification is proposed for better utilization of the existing knowledge. Existing adaptation methods for cross-scene classification only consider the marginal distribution, while the conditional distribution is equally important in real applications. In addition, approaches based on deep learning align the distribution of features extracted from a single-scale structure, leading to the loss of information. To overcome the above drawbacks, an Attention-based Multiscale Residual Adaptation Network (AMRAN) is proposed for cross-scene classification tasks. In the proposed AMRAN, both the marginal and conditional distributions are taken into consideration for more comprehensive alignment. Besides, the attention mechanism and the multiscale strategy are used to extract more robust features and more complete information, respectively. Experimental results between four existing scene classification data sets demonstrate that AMRAN has a significant improvement compared with the state-of-the-art deep adaptation methods.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2021.3056624","National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2018YFA0605500); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:41820104006,61871299,41871243); Science and Technology Major Project of Hubei Province (Next-Generation AI Technologies)(grant numbers:2019AEA170); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities of China; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9377566","Attention mechanism;cross-scene classification;deep domain adaptation;multiscale feature extraction;remote sensing (RS);residual learning","Feature extraction;Task analysis;Data mining;Adaptation models;Transfer learning;Periodic structures;Manifolds","feature extraction;geophysical image processing;image classification;image representation;learning (artificial intelligence);remote sensing","marginal distribution;conditional distribution;cross-scene classification tasks;attention mechanism;deep adaptation methods;attention-based multiscale residual adaptation network;AMRAN;remote sensing","","8","","65","IEEE","12 Mar 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In recent years, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have become an important choice in the field of semantic segmentation of remote sensing images. However, generic CNN models present many problems when performing water body segmentation, such as: 1) blurred water body boundaries; 2) difficulty in accommodating different scales of rivers, often losing information about many small-scale rivers; and 3) a large number of trainable parameters. This article proposes an end-to-end CNN structure based on multiscale residuals and squeeze-and-excitation (SE)-attention for water segmentation, called MRSE-Net. MRSE-Net consists of an encoder–decoder and a skip connection, which captures contextual information at different scales using the encoder, and then passes the encoder feature mapping through the improved skip connection, while localization is achieved by the decoder is implemented. With the multiscale residual module, the number of parameters in our model can be significantly reduced and water pixels can be extracted accurately. The SE-attention module is used to enhance the prediction results, mitigate the blurring effect, and make the segmented water boundaries more continuous. Landsat-8 images are used to train our model and validate our proposed method’s performance and effectiveness. In addition, we evaluate our method on Landsat-7 and Sentinel-2 images and obtain the best water segmentation results.

The summaries generated by abstractive summarization models often contain various kinds of factual errors. Thus, fact correction becomes essential to apply abstractive summarization to real-world applications. However, most existing methods for fact correction focus only on entity-level errors, which occasions the error correction methods to miss non-entity errors such as inconsistent tokens or mentions. Therefore, this paper presents a token-level fact correction that resolves inconsistencies of a system-generated summary at the token level. Since a token is the smallest meaning-bearing unit, all kinds of errors can be corrected if the errors are rectified at this level. The proposed fact corrector examines the consistency of a summary at the summary level like existing methods, but corrects the found inconsistencies at the token level. Thus, the proposed corrector consists of three modules of a summary fact checker, a token fact checker, and a fact emender. The summary fact checker inspects if a system-generated summary is factually consistent with a source text, the token fact checker finds out the tokens which cause inconsistency, and the fact emender actually replaces the inconsistency-causing tokens with correct tokens in the source text. Since these modules are closely related and affect one another, they are jointly trained to improve the performance of each module. The effectiveness of the proposed fact corrector is empirically proven from two viewpoints of consistency and summarization performance. For correcting inconsistencies in a summary, it is shown that the summaries by the proposed corrector are more factually consistent than those by its competitors. In addition, the proposed corrector outperforms the current state-of-the-art corrector even in automatic summarization performance.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3233854","National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF); Korean Government (MSIT)(grant numbers:2021R1F1A1048181); Institute of Information and Communications Technology Planning and Evaluation (IITP); Korean Government (MSIT) through Artificial Intelligence Innovation Hub(grant numbers:2021-0-02068); Artificial Intelligence Convergence Innovation Human Resources Development (Kyung Hee University)(grant numbers:RS-2022-00155911); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10005108","Token-level fact correction;factual consistency in abstractive summarization;summary fact checker;token fact checker;fact emender","Training data;Error correction;Abstracts;Measurement;Content analysis;Data models;Data mining;Text analysis","abstracting;error correction;natural language processing;text analysis","abstractive summarization models;correct tokens;entity-level errors;error correction methods;fact corrector;fact emender;factual errors;inconsistency-causing tokens;inconsistent tokens;nonentity errors;smallest meaning-bearing unit;source text;source-consistent summary;summary fact checker;system-generated summary;token fact checker;token-level fact correction","","","","28","CCBY","3 Jan 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Therefore, this article proposes a strategy of joint unmixing and multitemporal spatial information coguidance (JUC) to fully exploit the spatio-temporal-spectral features. First, a multitemporal joint unmixing method is used to achieve endmembers’ extraction and abundance estimation. Wherein the method adds spectral perturbed regularization when compared to the traditional unmixing strategy, making it robust to spectral variability. Second, we propose a multitemporal coguidance method that highlights the contrast between changed and unchanged regions and removes the noise by transferring the common structure information between the multitemporal first principal component map and the abundance difference maps. It will obtain an enhanced abundance difference maps and achieve effective combination of multitemporal spatial information. The final change result can be obtained by combining and thresholding these enhanced abundance difference maps. Experiments on some data sets demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is sufficiently valid and robust for multitemporal images, especially for data containing spectral variabilities and obvious structures.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2020.3045799","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61871150); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9321711","Change detection (CD);hyperspectral image;joint unmixing;multitemporal information coguidance","Hyperspectral imaging;Perturbation methods;Feature extraction;Training;Optimization;Task analysis;Data mining","feature extraction;geophysical image processing;hyperspectral imaging;principal component analysis","multitemporal joint unmixing method;spectral perturbed regularization;spectral variability;multitemporal first principal component map;difference maps;multitemporal hyperspectral images change detection;spectral information;multitemporal spatial information coguidance;spatio-temporal-spectral features;spatial co-exploitation capabilities","","11","","33","IEEE","13 Jan 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

It mainly consists of two procedures, i.e., endmember extraction and abundance estimation. Although most algorithms for each of the two procedures may exhibit good performance, few studies have been done considering both problems simultaneously. Therefore, hyperspectral unmixing accuracy is normally achieved by exploring all possible combinations of the two types of algorithms, which renders high computational overloads. We propose a novel orthogonal projection framework to conduct fast hyperspectral unmixing. It addresses both endmember extraction and abundance estimation with orthogonal projection endmember (OPE) and orthogonal projection abundance (OPA). Especially, the pixel with the largest orthogonal projection on any pixel is considered to be an endmember. We randomly choose one pixel from the hyperspectral data to compute the orthogonal projections of all pixels and extract the pixel with the largest projection as the first endmember. To avoid extracting the same endmembers, we compute orthogonal projections of all pixels to endmembers that have been previously extracted, and the pixel with the largest projection is considered as the next endmember.

Previous methods either convert point clouds as probability density models but ignore the rich feature of point clouds or only extract the local feature of point clouds without considering the global information. They did not fully utilize the point cloud information, so the characterization abilities of these methods are limited. To solve the above problems, we propose a point cloud registration based on learning Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) with global-weighted local representations. On the one hand, the point cloud is converted to GMM for registration. Unlike discrete point cloud data, GMM is a compact and lightweight representation. On the other hand, we generate GMM by extracting unique local features and global information from the point cloud. The global information is used to weigh the local features. Thus, the resulting GMM is a distribution with global-weighted local feature information representation ability, fully exploring the point cloud’s local and global information. At the same time, we design a learning guide module to directly solve the transformation without following the expectation maximization (EM)-solving paradigm. Benefiting from the combination of GMM and learning deep information, this formulation greatly improves the ability to characterize point clouds. Our method shows superiority in registration accuracy and generalization performance on synthetic and real-world datasets. The source code will be made public.","1558-0571","","10.1109/LGRS.2023.3256005","Natural Science Foundation of Hunan Province, China(grant numbers:2022JJ30746); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10066279","Feature representation;Gaussian mixture model (GMM);point cloud registration","Point cloud compression;Feature extraction;Data mining;Predictive models;Task analysis;Rail to rail inputs;Optimization","expectation-maximisation algorithm;feature extraction;Gaussian processes;image registration;image representation;learning (artificial intelligence);mixture models;probability","discrete point cloud data;global information;global-weighted local feature information representation ability;global-weighted local representations;learning Gaussian mixture models;point cloud information;point cloud registration","","","","24","IEEE","10 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

B-mode ultrasound (BUS), color Doppler flow imaging (CDFI), ultrasound elastography (UE) and dynamic contrast-enhanced ultrasound provide effective tools for identification but synthesis of modality information is a challenge for clinicians. Therefore, based on deep learning, rationally fusing these modalities with clinical information to personalize the classification of metastatic CLA requires new explorations. In this paper, we propose Multi-step Modality Fusion Network (MSMFN) for multi-modal ultrasound fusion to identify histological subtypes of metastatic CLA. MSMFN can mine the unique features of each modality and fuse them in a hierarchical three-step process. Specifically, first, under the guidance of high-level BUS semantic feature maps, information in CDFI and UE is extracted by modality interaction, and the static imaging feature vector is obtained. Then, a self-supervised feature orthogonalization loss is introduced to help learn modality heterogeneity features while maintaining maximal task-consistent category distinguishability of modalities. Finally, six encoded clinical information are utilized to avoid prediction bias and improve prediction ability further. Our three-fold cross-validation experiments demonstrate that our method surpasses clinicians and other multi-modal fusion methods with an accuracy of 80.06%, a true-positive rate of 81.81%, and a true-negative rate of 80.00%. Our network provides a multi-modal ultrasound fusion framework that considers prior clinical knowledge and modality-specific characteristics.

However, this issue is becoming a challenge for computer vision because of various technical barriers, such as large-scale variation, complex background interference, and nonuniform density distribution. Recent results show hopeful prospects for object counting using convolutional neural networks (CNNs), but most existing CNN-based methods draw on larger and more complex architectures, which leads to a huge computational and storage burdens, severely limiting their application in real-world scenarios. In this article, a lightweight multiscale feature fusion network for remote sensing object counting, named LMSFFNet, is presented to achieve a better balance between the running speed of the network and the counting accuracy. Specifically, in the encoding process, we select a MobileViT module as the backbone of the network to reduce the numbers of network parameters and computing cost. In return, a cascade structure of the channel–spatial attention mechanisms compensates for the weaker feature extraction ability of the lightweight network. In the decoding process, a lightweight multiscale context fusion module (LMCFM) as a multiscale feature fusion module is developed to solve the problem that the number of parameters increases with the expansion of the object scale when extracting multiscale features. In addition, a lightweight counting scale pooling module (LCSPM) is used to mine the subtle features of the target object. Two kinds of typical object counting experiments, namely, experiments on remote sensing benchmarks (RSOC dataset) and crowd benchmarks (ShanghaiTech, UCF-QNRF, and UCF_CC_50 datasets), show the effectiveness of the proposed method.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2023.3238185","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:51805059); Science and Technology Research Program of Chongqing Municipal Education Commission(grant numbers:KJZD-K202001501,KJCX2020051,KJZD-M202101501,cqsrc202115); Chongqing Municipal Undergraduate Universities and Institutes Affiliated to the Chinese Academy of Sciences(grant numbers:HZ2021015); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10021616","Attention mechanism;efficient and lightweight network;multiscale feature fusion;object counting","Feature extraction;Remote sensing;Computer architecture;Interference;Task analysis;Decoding;Benchmark testing","cellular neural nets;computer vision;feature extraction;image motion analysis;image segmentation;image sequences;neural nets;object detection;remote sensing;sensor fusion;video signal processing","computing cost;convolutional neural networks;counting accuracy;crowd benchmarks;extracting multiscale features;huge computational storage burdens;lightweight counting scale pooling module;lightweight multiscale context fusion module;lightweight multiscale feature fusion network;lightweight network;multiscale feature fusion module;network parameters;object scale;remote sensing object counting;typical object counting experiments","","","","66","IEEE","19 Jan 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Mainly, the exploitation of contextual information in a fixed receptive field is the focus of previous research, which makes it difficult to generically extract buildings that vary greatly in size and shape, especially when isolated large buildings are surrounded by dense small buildings. To improve this problem, we attempt to teach the network to adjust the receptive field and enhance useful feature information adaptively. In this article, we propose a novel adaptive screening feature network (ASF-Net), which can independently screen and enhance effective feature information from two aspects. On the one hand, we propose a deepened space up-sampling block to screen useful information and help establish boundaries. On the other hand, we propose an Adaptive Information Utilization Block (AIUB) to enlarge the receptive field of feature maps and refine the incomplete building footprint. As a result, the more accurate multiscale building footprint is inferred from the enhanced features. Experimental results on the popular aerial image segmentation datasets show that ASF-Net obtains competitive results [80.2% intersection over union (IoU) on the Inria aerial image labeling dataset and 74.2% IoU on the Massachusetts buildings dataset] in comparison with several state-of-the-art models.

A hyperspectral image (HSI) with high spectral resolution provides abundant ground object information, which is expected by finer change detection. The existing convolutional neural network (CNN)-based methods extract image features with a fixed kernel, which is incompetent to cope with complicated object details at diverse scales in HSI. In this article, we propose a deep multiscale pyramid network enhanced with spatial–spectral residual attention (DMP $\text {s}^{2} $ raN) for HSI change detection, which has strong capability to mine multilevel and multiscale spatial–spectral features, improving the performance in complex changed regions. There are two key characteristics: 1) the multiscale spatial–spectral features are extracted by the multiscale pyramid convolution and enhanced by spatial–spectral residual attention module ( $\text {S}^{2} $ RAM) of each scale and 2) the multilevel features are obtained by aggregating the multiscale features level by level. As a result of this design, the proposed DMP $\text {s}^{2} $ raN learns more discriminative features with both strong semantic information and rich spatial–spectral information.

These methods generate pseudo labels, store centroid features in the memory bank, and periodically update them. However, affected by the performance of the clustering method, within each cluster exists inevitably noisy instances, and self-paced contrastive learning usually requires a large number of negative samples from various classes, where false-negative samples give rise to the class collision issue. These lead to performing incorrect model optimization. In this paper, we propose a non-contrastive nearest neighbor identity-guided (NNNI) method to overcome these challenges. The advantage of NNNI is to provide the model with a highly accurate prior. Specifically, this method relies on the random identity sampler commonly used in re-identification tasks to provide the network with a regression target of the nearest neighbors of the same identity within a mini-batch. It encodes more and more information in an iterative process through a Siamese network with an exponential moving average to train high-quality representations. NNNI alleviates the negative effects of noise instances and corrects class collision issues during training.

To alleviate this problem, this article presents a novel framework to model and understand the image dynamics by discovering latent information in Sentinel-1 SITS, even with limited ground truth data. The framework suggests how to use visualizations to efficiently integrate domain knowledge both for execution and evaluation of the machine-learning pipeline in the absence from ground truth data in SITS change studies. In a case study at a Polar region, we extend a limited amount of ground truth data and then discover its temporal evolution at image patch level, in an unsupervised manner. The trustworthiness of the framework is ensured by integration of domain knowledge and intelligent visual verification strategies. A visualization tool is also implemented for this purpose. The proposed framework contains two modules: a classifier and a change modeler. Our experiments show that a domain-knowledge-based classifier gives the best accuracy. The classifier semantically labeled the complete dataset of 24 study months, containing 153 600 patches with a size of 256 × 256 pixels by extending the available semantic labels from just three months. The temporal sequence of these sematic labels are then recorded and fed to a Bayesian model called Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to discover the underlying patterns. LDA generates a change map containing the dominant dynamic patterns to give a consolidated view of the evolution without having to browse the whole dataset. Further, color-coded change signatures explain the change classes.","2151-1535","","10.1109/JSTARS.2023.3273122","H2020 ExtremeEarth project(grant numbers:825258); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10127624","Change maps;color-coded change signatures;domain knowledge;Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA);satellite image time series (SITS);unsupervised;visualization","Semantics;Task analysis;Spatiotemporal phenomena;Data visualization;Time series analysis;Data mining;Classification algorithms","","","","","","25","CCBY","16 May 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Efficient detection of tax evasion has always been a crucial issue for both governments and academic researchers. Recent research has proposed the use of machine learning technology to detect tax evasion and has shown good results in some specific areas. Regrettably, there are still two major obstacles to detect tax evasion. First, it is hard to extract powerful features because of the complexity of tax data. Second, due to the complicated process of tax auditing, labeled data are limited in practice. Such obstacles motivate the contributions of this work. In this paper, we propose a novel tax evasion detection framework named FBNE-PU (Fusion of the basic feature and network embedding with PU learning for tax evasion detection), a multistage method for detecting tax evasion in real-life scenarios. In this paper, we perform an in-depth analysis of the characteristics of the transaction network and propose a novel network embedding algorithm, the PnCGCN. It significantly improves detection performance by extracting powerful features from basic features and the tax-related transaction network.

This article proposes an attention-based convolutional recurrent neural network (ACRNN) to extract more discriminative features from EEG signals and improve the accuracy of emotion recognition. First, the proposed ACRNN adopts a channel-wise attention mechanism to adaptively assign the weights of different channels, and a CNN is employed to extract the spatial information of encoded EEG signals. Then, to explore the temporal information of EEG signals, extended self-attention is integrated into an RNN to recode the importance based on intrinsic similarity in EEG signals.

Given that evacuation is a checking process rather than a preselection process, evolutionary game theory can be used to better understand the crowd dynamics by analyzing the imitation effects in terms of individual interactions during evacuation. The key purpose of this paper was to construct an evolutionary game model of emergency evacuation of a teaching building at a university after an earthquake to search for the specific constraints necessary to reach the expected collective behaviors for orderly evacuation. We first analyzed the evacuation scenarios, including the environment of the teaching building, emergency degree of the earthquake and behaviors of the crowd. The related game players in the evacuation process were divided into three types, impulsive evacuees, calm evacuees and university staffs, and their payoff matrix was constructed according to the evacuation scenarios. Then, an evolutionary game model via the replicated dynamic system was created, and stable strategies were discussed. Next, we simulated eighteen evacuation scenarios with adjustment of the guiding authoritativeness, emergency degree, and group-oriented coefficient; the simulation results showed that the worst stable strategies can be avoided and the expected stable strategies can be obtained by adjusting the constraints, which are closely related to the corresponding management measures.

With the explosive growth of user terminals (UTs) and data traffic, the integration of massive multiple-input multiple-output (mMIMO) techniques and LEO satellite communication systems has been regarded as a novel idea to enhance system capacity and realize global seamless high-speed interconnection. However, obtaining effective downlink channel state information (CSI) and establishing a simple and efficient hybrid beamforming mechanism are challenging tasks due to the limitations of objective factors, such as high dynamic, long delay, and low payload in LEO satellite scenarios. It is embodied in three aspects: 1) the untenable channel reciprocity in time division duplex (TDD) systems; 2) the training feedback costs and feedback delay in frequency division duplex (FDD) systems; and 3) the complex nonconvex optimization process faced by hybrid beamforming design. Driven by the performance advantages of the deep learning (DL) technology to deal with various problems in the field of physical layer communications, this article proposes to use a deep neural network (DNN) to solve the above challenges, and constructs SatCP and SatHB schemes for realizing downlink CSI acquirement and hybrid beamforming design, respectively. By deeply mining the potential correlation of the uplink-downlink channels between LEO satellites and UTs and exploring the mapping relationship between CSI and beamformers, the SatCP can assist LEO satellites to directly predict the future downlink CSI based on the observed uplink CSI with no need for downlink channel estimation, while the SatHB can easily generate the corresponding beamformers based on the downlink CSI predicted by the SatCP without requiring complex optimization. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed SatCP and SatHB can play an effective auxiliary role in LEO satellite mMIMO communication systems.","2327-4662","","10.1109/JIOT.2022.3190412","National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2018YFB1801103); Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province of China(grant numbers:BK20192002); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61671476,61901516,62171466); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9826890","Channel prediction;deep learning (DL);hybrid beamforming;low-Earth orbit (LEO) satellite;massive multiple-input multiple-output (mMIMO)","Low earth orbit satellites;Satellites;Array signal processing;Downlink;Satellite broadcasting;Radio frequency;Communication systems","array signal processing;channel capacity;channel estimation;concave programming;deep learning (artificial intelligence);frequency division multiplexing;MIMO communication;satellite communication;telecommunication computing;telecommunication traffic;time division multiplexing;wireless channels","channel reciprocity;deep learning technology;deep neural network;downlink channel estimation;FDD systems;frequency division duplex systems;high-speed interconnection;hybrid beamforming design;Internet of Things services;IoT services;LEO satellite massive MIMO system;LEO satellite mMIMO communication systems;low-Earth orbit satellites;nonconvex optimization process;TDD systems;time division duplex systems;uplink-downlink channel state information;uplink-downlink CSI","","2","","43","IEEE","12 Jul 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Local Differential Privacy (LDP)-based data collection is a promising technology to protect sensitive information. A mobile device modify data to make each piece of data indistinguishable from others but keep its intrinsic value for statistical characteristics in data. Although LDP fundamentally protects the privacy exposure from a data store, a datastore suffer a shortcomings on it; as a datastore can never validate the modified data due to concealed raw data, that allows anyone to tamper with one’s data or inject any amount of data, and thus manipulate the statistics of the whole data in a datastore, called data poisoning attack. As a device does not disclose raw data and a datastore cannot collaborate to validate data with a device who may be an adversary on this mutual distrust relationship, data collection needs an ability to avoid the effect of data poisoning.. The cause of data poisoning is the direct relationship between data volume and statistic; the more data a device sends gives more statistical changes on merged data in a datastore. In this paper, we propose to decouple statistical characteristics from data volumes on LDP-based data collection process to minimize the effect of poisoned data on a datastore. We utilize Oblivious Transfer (OT) protocol to retrieve only statistic characteristics of receiving data at a datastore. As OT protocol inevitably strengthen privacy protection on LDP-based data collection and accordingly drops statistic characteristics of data, We adjust LDP processing to collaboratively work with OT protocol. The proposed adjustment method adapts the protection strength of LDP to OT protocol behavior so that a data store receives data containing sufficient statistical characteristics. We conduct qualitative and experimental overhead analysis and show that our method decouples the relationship between statistical characteristics from data volume. Our experimental result also prove that the overhead can be acceptable on devices such as smartphones and IoT.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3251560","Information-Technology Promotion Agency (IPA)’s Industrial Cyber Security Centre of Excellence (ICS-CoE) Core Human Resources Development Program; Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS)’s KAKENHI(grant numbers:JP22J23910); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10057407","Local differential privacy;oblivious transfer protocol;location data;privacy-preserving data mining;data security","Protocols;Data collection;Privacy;Perturbation methods;Proposals;Differential privacy;Receivers;Location awareness;Data security","computer network security;data privacy;Internet of Things;mobile computing;smart phones","called data poisoning attack;concealed raw data;data store;data volume;datastore;LDP-based data collection process;Local Differential Privacy-based data collection;location data;merged data;modified data;Oblivious statistic collection;poisoned data;statistic characteristics;sufficient statistical characteristics","","","","37","CCBYNCND","2 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To improve the generalization ability, recent hybrid methods have been explored to extract task-aware handcrafted features (e.g., Local Binary Pattern) as discriminative information for the input of DNNs. However, the handcrafted feature extraction relies on experts’ domain knowledge, and how to choose appropriate handcrafted features is underexplored. To this end, we propose a learnable network to extract Meta Pattern (MP) in our learning-to-learn framework. By replacing handcrafted features with the MP, the discriminative information from MP is capable of learning a more generalized model. Moreover, we devise a two-stream network to hierarchically fuse the input RGB image and the extracted MP by using our proposed Hierarchical Fusion Module (HFM).

In particular, the convolutional neural network (CNN) based methods have progressed. However, due to the high dimensionality of HSI and equal treatment of all bands, the performances of CNN based methods are hampered. The labels of land-covers often differ between edge and the center pixels in pixel-centered spatial information. These edge pixels may weaken the discrimination of spatial features and reduce classification accuracy. Motivated by the attention mechanism of the human visual system, the spatial proximity feature selection with residual spatial–spectral attention network is proposed in this article. It contains a residual spatial attention module, a residual spectral attention module, and a spatial proximity feature selection module. The residual spatial attention module aims to select the crucial spatial information, which assigns weights to different features by measuring the similarity between the surrounding elements and their central ones. The residual spectral attention module is designed for spectral bands which are selected from raw input data by emphasizing the valuable bands and suppressing the valueless. According to the spatial distribution of features, the spatial proximity feature selection module is used to filter features effectively.

NRL, also known as network embedding, aims at preserving graph structures in a low-dimensional space. These learned representations can be used for subsequent machine learning tasks, such as vertex classification, link prediction, and data visualization. Recently, graph convolutional network (GCN)-based models, e.g., GraphSAGE, have drawn a lot of attention for their success in inductive NRL. When conducting unsupervised learning on large-scale graphs, some of these models employ negative sampling (NS) for optimization, which encourages a target vertex to be close to its neighbors while being far from its negative samples. However, NS draws negative vertices through a random pattern or based on the degrees of vertices. Thus, the generated samples could be either highly relevant or completely unrelated to the target vertex. Moreover, as the training goes, the gradient of NS objective calculated with the inner product of the unrelated negative samples and the target vertex may become zero, which will lead to learning inferior representations. To address these problems, we propose an adversarial training method tailored for unsupervised inductive NRL on large networks. For efficiently keeping track of high-quality negative samples, we design a caching scheme with sampling and updating strategies that has a wide exploration of vertex proximity while considering training costs. Besides, the proposed method is adaptive to various existing GCN-based models without significantly complicating their optimization process.

To capture the nearest opinion of the aspect term, researchers have used the relative distance between an aspect term and all other words in a sentence.

"Examining the Characteristics of Practical Knowledge From Four Public Facebook Communities of Practice in Instructional Design and Technology","J. Leung","School of Information Science and Learning Technologies, University of Missouri, Columbia, MO, USA","IEEE Access","5 Sep 2022","2022","10","","90669","90689","Instructional design and technology (IDT) professionals participate in communities of practice (CoPs) on Facebook to seek pedagogical and educational technology advice for solving instructional design (ID) problems. Much of the IDT literature has focused on formal educational environments and not on nonformal settings outside the classroom and beyond formal education. Further analysis of tacit or practical knowledge exchanged among community members is required to understand the purpose, functions, and organizational knowledge capital in online CoPs. To fill this gap, this study uses natural language processing (NLP) to analyze the practical knowledge of 6,066 anonymized users’ posts from four large public IDT CoPs on Facebook from September 2017 to September 2020 after cleaning the dataset. User posts were publicly available and required no password authentication for access, including Instructional Designer (4,717), Designers for Learning (228), Adobe Captivate Users (599), and Articulate Storyline (522). The proposed methodology aims to extract practical knowledge of individual online CoPs in three parts. First, the characteristics of written communication among members are extracted by calculating word and sentence lengths, word frequencies, and contiguous words. Second, the characteristics of members’ exchange of practical knowledge are obtained through sentiment identification, entity recognition, and relationships between pedagogical and educational technology entities. Third, the functions of individual online CoPs are developed through topic modeling with latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) and BERTopic.

Therefore, we propose a novel, precise, and fast segmentation scheme for offshore farms in high-resolution SAR images based on model fusion and half-precision parallel inference. Specifically, we propose several new high-performance improved UNet++ methods and reasonably fuse the test results. At the same time, a simulated annealing strategy and a morphological closing operation are introduced to improve the segmentation accuracy. In addition, we find that resizing the images to 256 × 256 pixels is better than 512 × 512 pixels for this task, which not only has higher segmentation accuracy but can also increase the inference speed by nearly 13%. Furthermore, a novel half-precision parallel inference strategy is proposed, which can fully utilize the GPU and increase the inference speed by 72.6%. Compared with some state-of-the-art methods, the proposed scheme that merges two improved UNet++ achieves superior accuracy with a frequency weighted intersection over union of 0.9876 and a single image inference time of 0.0218 s on the high-resolution SAR offshore farm dataset.","2151-1535","","10.1109/JSTARS.2022.3181355","Innovation Project of Equipment Development Department–Information Perception Technology(grant numbers:E01Z040601); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9793701","Half-precision parallel inference;improved UNET++;SAR images;segmentation;simulated annealing","Image segmentation;Feature extraction;Task analysis;Radar polarimetry;Licenses;Simulated annealing;Data mining","aquaculture;image segmentation;radar imaging;simulated annealing;synthetic aperture radar","high-resolution SAR images;model fusion;high-resolution synthetic aperture radar images;segment offshore farms;reasonable layout;statistics;conventional segmentation methods;slow inference speed;precise, segmentation scheme;fast segmentation scheme;half-precision parallel inference strategy;single image inference time;high-resolution SAR offshore farm dataset;time 0.0218 s","","","","66","CCBYNCND","10 Jun 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Most existing convolutional neural network (CNN)-based methods adopt an early/late fusion strategy to fuse the low-/high-level features for classification, which still has two inherent challenges: 1) the conventional convolution operation performs a weighted average operation on each pixel in the receptive field, which will reduce the discriminability of the center pixel due to the influence of the interference pixels and 2) the spatial–spectral features of the hyperspectral image (HSI), the elevation features of light detection and ranging (LiDAR), and the complementary features between the multimodal data are not fully exploited, which results in the reduction of classification accuracy. In this article, an effective multibranch feature fusion network with self- and cross-guided attention (MB2FscgaNet) is proposed for the joint classification of LiDAR and HSI. The main concern of this article is how to accurately estimate more effective spectral–spatial-elevation features and yield more effective transfer in the network. Specifically, MB2FscgaNet adopts a multibranch feature fusion architecture to fully exploit the hierarchical features from LiDAR and HSI level by level. At each level of the network, a self- and cross-guided attention (SCGA) is developed to assign a higher weight to interesting areas and channels of LiDAR and HSI feature maps to obtain refined spectral–spatial-elevation features and provide complementary information cross-guidance between LiDAR and HS. We further designed a spectral supplement module (SeSuM) to improve the discriminative ability of the center pixel. Comparative classification results and ablation studies demonstrate that the proposed MB2FscgaNet achieves competitive performance against state-of-the-art methods.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2022.3179737","National Defense Pre-Research Foundation; Higher Education Discipline Innovation Project(grant numbers:B08038); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62101414); Natural Science Basic Research Plan in Shaanxi Province of China(grant numbers:2021JQ-194,2021JQ-197); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(grant numbers:XJS210108,XJS210104); China Post-Doctoral Science Foundation(grant numbers:2021M702546,2021M702548); Scientific and Technological Activities for Overseas Students of Shaanxi Province(grant numbers:2020-017); Basic and Applied Basic Research Foundation of Guangdong Province(grant numbers:2020A1515110856); Yangtze River Scholar Bonus Schemes of China(grant numbers:CJT160102); Ten Thousand Talent Program; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9790044","Hyperspectral image (HSI);joint classification;light detection and ranging (LiDAR);self- and cross-guided attention (SCGA)","Feature extraction;Laser radar;Data mining;Task analysis;Fuses;Principal component analysis;Hyperspectral imaging","convolutional neural nets;geophysical image processing;geophysical techniques;hyperspectral imaging;image classification;land cover;optical radar","multisource data;land cover classification;convolutional neural network-based methods;weighted average operation;interference pixels;hyperspectral image;complementary features;multimodal data;classification accuracy;multibranch feature fusion network;multibranch feature fusion architecture;hierarchical features;HSI level;complementary information cross-guidance;spectral supplement module;MB2FscgaNet;refined spectral-spatial-elevation features;lidar classification;CNN;light detection and ranging;self- and cross-guided attention;SCGA;SeSuM","","5","","38","IEEE","7 Jun 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, the present transfer learning-based methods usually transfer knowledge from a single source domain, such as the natural image domain. Therefore, these methods cannot simultaneously transfer spectral and spatial knowledge to the target domain in HSIs. Generally, the natural image has rich spatial structure and texture information, while the HSI has abundant spectral information. To better utilize the knowledge learned from natural image datasets and HSI datasets, we proposed a multimodal transfer feature fusion network (MTFFN) for HSI classification. In MTFFN, a dual-branch network structure is designed to transfer the two-modal knowledge from the natural image domain and the source HSI domain to the target domain in two branches, respectively. A multitask learning strategy is adopted to achieve feature fusion. The fused features are used to generate the final classification result. Moreover, a local attention mechanism is designed to extract more meaningful spectral features.

However, they have the deficiency of insufficient contextual information aggregation, thus resulting in false and missed detections, and it is difficult to refine the detection of change edges. To alleviate these problems and obtain more accurate results, we propose an efficient self-weighted spatial–temporal attention network (SSANet). In contrast to the Siamese structure, our network is a novel joint learning framework composed of fusion subnetwork, difference subnetwork, and decoder. Fusion subnetwork is used to extract multiscale object features where we propose a multicore channel-aligning attention (MCA) module to capture the long-range semantic information for multiscale context aggregation. Difference subnetwork is used to extract the difference variation features, where we propose a feature differential reconfiguration (FDR) module to learn the temporal change information. FDR can effectively filter change information and reconstruct features to improve the perception of changed regions. To better balance the MCA and FDR modules, an asymmetric weighting (AW) module is proposed in the decoder to self-weight the multiscale features and generate the change map.

The most intriguing applications of 3D-AR involve visualizations of anatomy or surgical plans that appear directly on the patient. However, commercially available 3D-AR devices have spatial localization errors that are too large for many clinical procedures. For this reason, a variety of approaches for improving 3D-AR registration accuracy have been explored. The focus of this review is on the methods, accuracy, and clinical applications of registering 3D-AR devices with the clinical environment. The works cited represent a variety of approaches for registering holograms to patients, including manual registration, computer vision-based registration, and registrations that incorporate external tracking systems. Evaluations of user accuracy when performing clinically relevant tasks suggest that accuracies of approximately 2 mm are feasible. 3D-AR device limitations due to the vergence-accommodation conflict or other factors attributable to the headset hardware add on the order of 1.5 mm of error compared to conventional guidance.

In this paper, in order to overcome the above problems, we propose an effective lightweight encoding-decoding crowd counting network, named Lw-Count. Specifically, in the encoding process, we design an efficient and lightweight convolution module (ELCM), which extracts the crowd features in the network through a refined ghost block to reduce the network parameters and computing cost, and solves the problem of inaccurate counting caused by uneven crowd distribution through spatial group normalization (SGN). In the decoding process, we design a scale regression module (SRM) to reduce the error details and chessboard effect caused by linear interpolation and deconvolution. In addition, we design a new loss function, which enhances the spatial correlation of the density map and the sensitivity of the crowd through a regional normalized cross-correlation loss and counting loss, to ensure the counting accuracy. Extensive experiments on five mainstream datasets demonstrate that Lw-Count achieves an optimal trade-off between counting performance and running speed compared with other methods.","1558-2205","","10.1109/TCSVT.2022.3171235","Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province(grant numbers:BK20191284); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61801222); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9765482","Crowd counting;efficient and lightweight convolution module;scale regression module;regional normalized cross-correlation loss","Feature extraction;Data mining;Correlation;Graphics processing units;Decoding;Costs;Computer science","complex networks;decoding;encoding;feature extraction;filtering theory;image resolution;interpolation;iterative methods;least squares approximations;object detection;optimisation;regression analysis;video surveillance","effective lightweight encoding-decoding crowd counting network;counting performance;larger network structures;more complex network structures;named Lw-Count;efficient convolution module;lightweight convolution module;inaccurate counting;uneven crowd distribution;regional normalized cross-correlation loss;counting loss;counting accuracy;running speed","","1","","74","IEEE","29 Apr 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We propose a multi-source information fusion network (MSFNet) for ORSI super-resolution to address this problem. We mainly consider three strategies to enhance the image super-resolution performance, including feature extraction strategy, information fusion strategy, and the structure of the unfolding network. Firstly, image information of various scales is helpful for mining potential features of images for image super-resolution. Therefore, we introduce multi-scale implicit constraints to the objective function. Secondly, we unfold the optimization process into a neural network by alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). This unfolding strategy can effectively utilize the prior information for image reconstruction. Thirdly, we propose a row-column decoupling Transformer module for feature fusion. Specifically, the row Transformer block completes the feature fusion of various scales, and the column Transformer block completes the feature fusion of various channels. The fused features are transmitted to the next iteration stage for feature enhancement.

JIT defect prediction finds error-prone changes instead of error-prone modules, and as a result, the developer only needs to investigate error-prone changed lines instead of the entire module. When building JIT defect prediction models, researchers used various metrics, including developer experience metrics which measure the developer’s experiences. Despite the fact that software defectiveness is likely to be affected by the experience of developers, developer metrics were understudied in the literature.

Despite the existing convolutional neural network-based methods that have achieved remarkable progress on building extraction from remote sensing images, the accurate extraction of buildings with extremely large variations of scales and layouts is still challenging. In this study, a novel multiregion scale-aware network is proposed to address these issues. The network consists of two key components. First, a multiregion attention module is proposed to capture long-range context dependencies and exploit different regions’ attention information, alleviating the interference of cluttered backgrounds and variations in building layouts. With the multiscale features generated by a backbone network as input, a graph-based scale-aware structure is designed to model and reason the interactions between different scale features to enable a better understanding of multiscale features.

The current trend toward Software-Defined Networking (SDN) has allowed new possibilities in virtual network embedding. In this work, we propose a distributed virtual network embedding for SDNs called DVSDNE using multi-agent systems. This framework could be used to run a centralized VNE algorithm in a distributed manner to scale these algorithms with respect to network size. DVSDNE uses agents to spread the load across the substrate network. Our simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.

However, novice and armature players’ voices are often inadvertently overlooked because of a lack of effective analytical methods, despite the close collaboration between professional esports teams and operators. To ensure the quality of esports game services and establish a balanced gaming environment, it is essential to consider the opinions of unprofessional players and comprehensively analyze their reviews. This study proposes a new framework for analyzing esports reviews of players. It incorporates two key components: topic modeling and sentiment analysis. Utilizing the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) algorithm, the framework effectively identifies diverse topics within reviews. These identified topics were subsequently employed in a prevalence analysis to uncover the associations between players’ concerns and various esports games. Moreover, it leverages cutting-edge Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) in conjunction with a Transformer (TFM) downstream layer, enabling accurate detection of players’ sentiments toward different topics. We experimented using a dataset containing 1.6 million English reviews collected up to December 2021 for four esports games on Steam: TEKKEN7, Dota2, PUBG, and CS:GO. The experimental results demonstrated that the proposed framework can efficiently identify players’ concerns and reveal interesting keywords underlying their reviews.

In this study, we propose a Modified Artificial Bee Colony algorithm (MABC) to solve the MMKP. The MABC employs surrogate relaxation, Hamming distance, and a tabu list to enhance the local search process and exploit neighborhood information. We evaluated the performance of the MABC on standard benchmark instances and compared it with several state-of-the-art algorithms, including RLS, ALMMKP, ACO, PEGF-PERC, TIKS-TIKS2 and D-QPSO. The experimental results reveal that MABC produces highly competitive solutions in terms of the best solutions found, achieving approximately 2% of the optimal solutions with trivial (milliseconds) CPU time. The Kruskal-Wallis test revealed that there was no statistically significant difference in the objective function values between the MABC algorithm and other state-of-the-art algorithms (H = 0.31506, p = 0.98882). However, for CPU efficiency, the test showed a statistically significant difference (H = 84.90850, p = 0), indicating that the MABC algorithm exhibited significantly better CPU efficiency (with shorter execution times) than the other algorithms did.

Given a document of any domains, the model needs to figure out the sentiments with respect to fine-grained aspects in the documents. Two main challenges exist in this problem. One is to build a robust document modeling across domains; the other is to mine the domain-specific aspects and make use of the sentiment lexicon. In this paper, we propose a novel approach Neural Attentive model for cross-domain Aspect-level sentiment CLassification (NAACL), which leverages the benefits of the supervised deep neural network as well as the unsupervised probabilistic generative model to strengthen the representation learning. NAACL jointly learns two tasks: (i) a domain classifier, working on documents in both the source and target domains to recognize the domain information of input texts and transfer knowledge from the source domain to the target domain. In particular, a weakly supervised Latent Dirichlet Allocation model (wsLDA) is proposed to learn the domain-specific aspect and sentiment lexicon representations that are then used to calculate the aspect/lexicon-aware document representations via a multi-view attention mechanism; (ii) an aspect-level sentiment classifier, sharing the document modeling with the domain classifier. It makes use of the domain classification results and the aspect/sentiment-aware document representations to classify the aspect-level sentiment of the document in domain adaptation scenario. NAACL is evaluated on both English and Chinese datasets with the out-of-domain as well as in-domain setups. Quantitatively, the experiments demonstrate that NAACL has robust superiority over the compared methods in terms of classification accuracy and F1 score.

The method can eliminate the problem of insufficient feature extraction and more redundancy within the RandLA-Net model, and achieve efficient recognition of the street trees. As an application of street tree recognition results, we studied the accurate calculation method of street tree shading area and designed a density-based iterative  $\alpha $ -shape algorithm.

To better extract such features from the vehicle image to improve the recognition accuracy, we propose a three-branch adaptive attention network—Global Relational Attention and Multi-granularity Feature Learning (GRMF) to improve feature representation and discrimination. First, we divide the network into three branches, extracting different and useful features from three perspectives: spatial location, channel information, and local information.

Specifically, to determine the importance level of a node, we use the global relationship between the node and all other nodes to infer the attention weight of the node directly. Third, according to the characteristics of the vehicle re-identification task, we introduce a suitable local partition strategy.

Some recent works have been proposed to estimate the intrinsic components using encoder-decoder structures. However, they generally lack exploration of the different component-oriented feature constraints and feature selection processes. In this paper, a non-local color compensation network (NCCNet) is proposed. Firstly, the hue and value channels of HSV color space are used as the complementary information for RGB images for the estimation of albedo and shading, respectively. The color space representation serves as an external constraint, which does not require expensive sensors or complicated computations. Secondly, an integrated non-local attention scheme is proposed to describe the relations of non-adjacent regions with a lower computational complexity compared to traditional methods. Then the non-local and local attention are combined to describe correlations among features and used as feature selectors between the encoder and decoder. Thirdly, the mutual constraint between albedo and shading is also explored in the network to further optimize the process. In order to train the network, a unified mutual exclusion loss function is proposed. Extensive experiments are conducted on several popular datasets, and the proposed NCCNet achieves improved performance with comparable computational cost compared to competing methods.","1558-2205","","10.1109/TCSVT.2022.3199428","Key Research and Development Projects of Shaanxi Province(grant numbers:2021ZDLGY15-01,2021ZDLGY09-04,2021GY-004,2022ZDLGY06-07); Shenzhen International Science and Technology Cooperation(grant numbers:GJHZ20200731095204013); Business Finland project AMALIA; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9858179","Intrinsic image decomposition;color compensation;multi-scale attention;mutual constraint","Image color analysis;Feature extraction;Image decomposition;Image reconstruction;Lighting;Task analysis;Decoding","feature extraction;feature selection;image colour analysis;image representation;neural nets;optimisation","albedo;color space representation;encoder-decoder structures;feature constraints;feature selection;HSV color space;intrinsic components;NCCNet;nonadjacent regions;nonlocal attention scheme;nonlocal color compensation network;RGB images;shading;single image-based intrinsic image decomposition;unified mutual exclusion loss function","","","","63","IEEE","17 Aug 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Spatial information is essential for grass resource management in pastoral areas, which can be extracted quickly on a large-scale by using remote sensing data. However, most conventional methods are based on the grid pixels of remote sensing images. The spatial information based on these regular units inevitably has the phenomenon of mixed pixels, which leads to the unreliability of grassland resource information with irregular spatial heterogeneity. To resolve this problem, this article takes the spatial mapping of fractional vegetation cover (FVC) as a typical target task of information extraction of grassland resources and proposes a geoparcel-based spatial prediction method in which irregular geographic objects from high spatial resolution remote sensing images, i.e., grassland geoparcels, are used as basic mapping units instead of traditional regular units. This change can make the spatial expression of mapping closer to the reality of grassland due to the fine spatial structure. Moreover, multisource spatial data can be integrated together in the regression-based procedure of prediction through the geoparcel as a unified spatial benchmark. A case experiment of Abag Banner, Inner Mongolia, China, shows that the proposed method can achieve good FVC mapping results. The spatial prediction of FVC based on grassland geoparcels is verified to be effective when a random forest regression is used in the modeling. In comparison with traditional regular grid-based methods, the proposed method achieves higher accuracy with 11.89% in relative root mean squared error (%RMSE), and 0.86 in determination coefficient of regression (R2). It has advantages in sensing the tiny spatial heterogeneity of FVC at the boundary of grassland change. The formalized procedure potentially promotes the development of spatial mapping technology for grassland resources.","2151-1535","","10.1109/JSTARS.2021.3110896","Major Science and Technology Project; Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region(grant numbers:2021SZD0036); Key Research and Development Program of Shaanxi(grant numbers:2021NY-170); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:42071316,41631179,61806022,12001057); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(grant numbers:300102120201,300102269205,300102320202,300102269103); National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2017YFB0503600); State Key Laboratory of Geo-Information Engineering(grant numbers:SKLGIE2018-M-3-4); Key Laboratory of Spatial Data Mining and Information Sharing of Ministry of Education; Fuzhou University(grant numbers:2018LSDMIS03); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9531475","Fractional vegetation cover (FVC);geoparcel;grassland;remote sensing;spatial prediction;vegetation index (VI)","Vegetation mapping;Remote sensing;Spatial resolution;Biological system modeling;Shape;Satellites;Indexes","geophysical image processing;land cover;random forests;regression analysis;vegetation;vegetation mapping","geoparcel-based spatial prediction method;grassland fractional vegetation cover;grass resource management;grassland resource information;high spatial resolution remote sensing images;grassland geoparcels;spatial mapping technology;Inner Mongolia;China;Abag Banner;random forest regression","","4","","66","CCBY","8 Sep 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The fusion network effectively guides summary generation based on the retrieved summary. Finally, READSUM extracts important keywords using an extractive approach and generates high-quality summaries using an abstractive approach that considers both the structural and sequential information of the source code.

The dynamic features applications have various characteristics: a) features are processed sequentially while the number of instances is fixed; and b) the feature space does not exist in advance. For example, in a text classification task for spam detection, new features (e.g. words) are dynamically generated and therefore need to be mined to filter out the spams rather than waiting for all features to be collected in order to do so. Traditional feature selection methods, which are not designed for streaming features applications, cannot be used in such an environment, as they require the full feature space in advance in order to statistically determine the representative features. Existing methods that address feature selection in dynamic features applications require the class labels in order to select the representative features. However, most of the real-life data is unlabeled and it is costly to apply manual labeling. In this paper, an efficient unsupervised features selection method is proposed for streaming features applications where the number of features increases while the number of instances remains fixed. In particular, unsupervised Feature Selection for Dynamic Features (UFSSF) is developed to determine the representative streaming features without requiring prior knowledge about data class labels or representative features. The UFSSF extends the k-mean clustering to cumulatively determine whether the newly-arrived feature can be selected as a representative streaming feature, or discarded. Experimental results show significant accuracy results and efficient execution time compared to those of other benchmark methods.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3082755","Australian Department of Industry, Innovation and Science for supporting this work under the Australia-China Science and Research Fund grant on the topic of “Resource Allocation for High-Volume Streaming Data in Data Centres”; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9438634","Feature selection;streaming features;unsupervised learning","Feature extraction;Heuristic algorithms;Computer science;Social networking (online);Real-time systems;Blogs;Machine learning algorithms","data mining;feature extraction;feature selection;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;pattern clustering;statistical analysis;text analysis;unsolicited e-mail;unsupervised learning","unsupervised Feature Selection method;effective Dynamic Features;dynamic features applications;feature space;traditional feature selection methods;representative features;efficient unsupervised features selection method;representative streaming feature;particular Feature Selection;features increases","","7","","29","CCBY","21 May 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Therefore, new methods that can clearly distinguish emotional states in EEG data are required. In this paper, we propose a new emotion recognition method, named AsEmo. The proposed method extracts effective features boosting classification performance on various emotional states from multi-class EEG data. AsEmo Automatically determines the number of spatial filters needed to extract significant features using the explained variance ratio (EVR) and employs a Subject-independent method for real-time processing of Emotion EEG data. The advantages of this method are as follows: (a) it automatically determines the spatial filter coefficients distinguishing emotional states and extracts the best features; (b) it is very robust for real-time analysis of new data using a subject-independent technique that considers subject sets, and not a specific subject; (c) it can be easily applied to both binary-class and multi-class data.

Therefore, the service provider can make full use of limited resources to improve the Quality of Service (QoS). Finally, we implement MB_DDPG based on real-world data sets and some synthetic data, and we also implement another two algorithms, genetic algorithm and random algorithm, as a contrast.

In this article, to solve this problem, we propose a novel regularized road surface extraction framework by introducing a graph neural network (GNN) for processing the road graph that is preconstructed from the easily accessible road centerlines. The proposed framework formulates the road surface extraction problem as two-sided width inference of the road graph and consists of a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based feature extractor and a GNN model for vertex attribute adjustment. The CNN extracts the high-level abstract features of each vertex in the graph as the input of the GNN and also the road boundary features that allow us to distinguish roads from the background. The GNN propagates and aggregates the features of the vertices in the graph to achieve global optimization of the regression of the regularized widths of the vertices. At the same time, a biased centerline map can also be corrected based on the width prediction result. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this is the first study to have introduced a GNN to regularized human-level road surface extraction. The proposed method was evaluated on four diverse datasets, and the results show that the proposed method comprehensively outperforms the recent CNN-based segmentation methods and other regularization methods in the intersection over union (IoU) and smoothness score, and a visual check shows that a majority of the prediction results of the proposed method approach the human delineation level.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2022.3151688","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:42171430); State Key Program of the National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:42030102); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9714410","Convolutional neural network (CNN);graph neural network (GNN);regularization;road extraction","Roads;Feature extraction;Remote sensing;Data mining;Task analysis;Convolutional neural networks;Satellites","feature extraction;graph theory;image classification;image segmentation;neural nets;remote sensing;roads","smooth road surface maps;human delineation level;regularized road surface extraction framework;graph neural network;road graph;easily accessible road centerlines;road surface extraction problem;two-sided width inference;convolutional neural network-based feature extractor;GNN model;high-level abstract features;road boundary features;roads;aggregates;regularized widths;biased centerline map;human-level road surface extraction;recent CNN-based segmentation methods;regularization methods;high-resolution remote sensing images;regularized road surface maps","","2","","38","CCBY","15 Feb 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Besides, these methods use clustering to obtain pseudolabels for training, and the pseudolabeled samples often involve errors, which can be considered as “label noise.” To address these issues, we propose a dual path denoising network (DPDNet) for SAR image change detection. In particular, we introduce the random label propagation to clean the label noise involved in preclassification. We also propose the distinctive patch convolution for feature representation learning to reduce the time consumption. Specifically, the attention mechanism is used to select distinctive pixels in the feature maps, and patches around these pixels are selected as convolution kernels. Consequently, the DPDNet does not require a great number of training samples for parameter optimization, and its computational efficiency is greatly enhanced. Extensive experiments have been conducted on five SAR datasets to verify the proposed DPDNet.

It has been reported that light detection and ranging (LiDAR) data can contribute complementary information to hyperspectral images (HSIs). In this article, a multiple feature-based superpixel-level decision fusion (MFSuDF) method is proposed for HSIs and LiDAR data classification. Specifically, superpixel-guided kernel principal component analysis (KPCA) is first designed and applied to HSIs to both reduce the dimensions and compress the noise impact. Next, 2-D and 3-D Gabor filters are, respectively, employed on the KPCA-reduced HSIs and LiDAR data to obtain discriminative Gabor features, and the magnitude and phase information are both taken into account. Three different modules, including the raw data-based feature cube (concatenated KPCA-reduced HSIs and LiDAR data), the Gabor magnitude feature cube, and the Gabor phase feature cube (concatenation of the corresponding Gabor features extracted from the KPCA-reduced HSIs and LiDAR data), can be, thus, achieved. After that, random forest (RF) classifier and quadrant bit coding (QBC) are introduced to separately accomplish the classification task on the aforementioned three extracted feature cubes. Alternatively, two superpixel maps are generated by utilizing the multichannel simple noniterative clustering (SNIC) and entropy rate superpixel segmentation (ERS) algorithms on the combined HSIs and LiDAR data, which are then used to regularize the three classification maps. Finally, a weighted majority voting-based decision fusion strategy is incorporated to effectively enhance the joint use of the multisource data. The proposed approach is, thus, named MFSuDF. A series of experiments are conducted on three real-world data sets to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed MFSuDF approach. The experimental results show that our MFSuDF can achieve the overall accuracy of 73.64%, 93.88%, and 74.11% for Houston, Trento, and Missouri University and University of Florida (MUUFL) Gulport data sets, respectively, when there are only three samples per class for training.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2020.2996599","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:41971300,61671307,61901278); Program for Young Changjiang Scholars; Research and Development Plan in Key Areas of Guangdong Province(grant numbers:2019B010151001); Shenzhen Scientific Research and Development Funding Program(grant numbers:JCYJ20180305124802421,JCYJ20180305125902403); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9109714","Feature extraction;feature fusion;hyperspectral image (HSI);light detection and ranging (LiDAR);superpixel segmentation","Laser radar;Feature extraction;Hyperspectral imaging;Sensors;Data mining","entropy;face recognition;feature extraction;Gabor filters;geophysical image processing;image classification;image segmentation;optical radar;principal component analysis;radar imaging;remote sensing by radar","Gabor phase feature cube;corresponding Gabor features;aforementioned three extracted feature cubes;combined HSIs;weighted majority voting-based decision fusion strategy;multisource data;real-world data sets;Florida Gulport data sets;multiple feature-based superpixel-level decision fusion;LiDAR data classification;multisource feature extraction;fusion techniques;classification accuracy;light detection;superpixel-guided kernel principal component analysis;3-D Gabor filters;discriminative Gabor features;raw data-based feature cube;concatenated KPCA-reduced HSIs;Gabor magnitude feature cube","","27","","71","IEEE","5 Jun 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Accurate estimation of the sound velocity distribution is the key basis for bone ultrasonic imaging. The sound velocity model is usually estimated using travel-time inversion based on the extraction of the time-of-flight (TOF). However, TOF extraction is an intractable task for bone imaging, since the first arrival signal is usually of a small amplitude and submerged in noise. To improve the accuracy of TOF extraction and further guarantee the accuracy of velocity inversion, a segmentation method using convolutional neural network was proposed in this work. The TOF extraction was translated into a binary segmentation problem and solved by the data-driven method. After sound velocity inversion, a velocity-corrected version of the Kirchhoff migration method (MKMM) was developed to reconstruct bone image. The performance of the proposed method was verified by numerical bone models and ex-vivo bovine femurs coated with soft-tissue phantoms. The results demonstrated that the proposed method provided more accurate TOF extractions (i.e., the errors < 0.24 μs for numerical models and < 0.4 μs for ex-vivo specimens). The resulting velocity inversion was significantly improved (the mean relative errors < 4.5% for numerical models and < 5.1% for ex-vivo samples). Moreover, the satisfactory reconstructions of bone and the overlying soft tissue can be observed. It is demonstrated that the proposed method is effective for bone ultrasonic imaging.","2333-9403","","10.1109/TCI.2022.3225670","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:11827808,11874289,12034005,12274094); Program of Shanghai Academic Research Leader(grant numbers:19XD1400500); China Postdoctoral Science Foundation(grant numbers:2019M661334,2022M720814); Shanghai Science and Technology Innovation Plan(grant numbers:20S31901300); Shanghai Rising-Star Program(grant numbers:21QC1400100); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9976242","Bone ultrasound imaging;deep learning;ultrasound computed tomography;U-Net;velocity inversion","Bones;Ultrasonic imaging;Imaging;Acoustics;Image segmentation;Deep learning;Data mining","acoustic tomography;biomechanics;biomedical ultrasonics;bone;convolutional neural nets;deep learning (artificial intelligence);image reconstruction;image segmentation;medical image processing;ultrasonic imaging","acoustic impedance contrast;bone image;bone ultrasonic imaging;bone ultrasound tomography;image bone;numerical bone models;numerical models;soft tissue;sound velocity distribution;sound velocity inversion;sound velocity model;TOF extraction;travel-time inversion;ultrasound imaging modalities;velocity inversion;velocity-corrected version","","","","69","IEEE","8 Dec 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, there are few methods to consider the negative impact caused by certain views with unclear clustering structures, resulting in poor multi-view clustering performance. To address this drawback, we propose self-supervised discriminative feature learning for deep multi-view clustering (SDMVC). Concretely, deep autoencoders are applied to learn embedded features for each view independently. To leverage the multi-view complementary information, we concatenate all views’ embedded features to form the global features, which can overcome the negative impact of some views’ unclear clustering structures. In a self-supervised manner, pseudo-labels are obtained to build a unified target distribution to perform multi-view discriminative feature learning. During this process, global discriminative information can be mined to supervise all views to learn more discriminative features, which in turn are used to update the target distribution. Besides, this unified target distribution can make SDMVC learn consistent cluster assignments, which accomplishes the clustering consistency of multiple views while preserving their features’ diversity. Experiments on various types of multi-view datasets show that SDMVC outperforms 14 competitors including classic and state-of-the-art methods.

For the main modality or each of the modalities, it is important to enhance the visual information by modeling the connection and effectively fusing the features among them. However, the existing methods for multimodal segmentation have a drawback; they coincidentally drop information of individual modality during the fusion process. Recently, graph learning-based methods have been applied in segmentation, and these methods have achieved considerable improvements by modeling the relationships across feature regions and reasoning using global information. In this paper, we propose a graph learning-based approach to efficiently extract modality-specific features and establish regional correspondence effectively among all modalities. In detail, after projecting features into a graph domain and employing graph convolution to propagate information across all regions for learning global modality-specific features, we propose a mutual information-based graph co-attention module to learn the weight coefficients of one bipartite graph constructed by the fully connected graphs having different modalities in the graph domain and by selectively fusing the node features. Based on the deformation diagram between the spatial-graph space and our proposed graph co-attention module, we present a multimodal prior-guided segmentation framework, which uses two strategies for two clinical situations: Modality-Specific Learning Strategy and Co-Modality Learning Strategy. Besides, the improved Co-Modality Learning Strategy is used with trainable weights in the multi-task loss for the optimization of the proposed framework. We validated our proposed modules and frameworks on two multimodal MRI datasets: our private liver lesion dataset and a public prostate zone dataset. Our experimental results on both datasets prove the superiority of our proposed approaches.","1558-2205","","10.1109/TCSVT.2021.3112551","Major Scientific Project of Zhejiang Lab(grant numbers:2020ND8AD01); Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research from the Japanese Ministry for Education, Science, Culture and Sports (MEXT)(grant numbers:20KK0234,21H03470,20K21821); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:82071988); Key Research and Development Program of Zhejiang Province(grant numbers:2019C03064); Program Co-Sponsored by Province and Ministry(grant numbers:WKJ-ZJ-1926); Special Fund for Basic Scientific Research Business Expenses of Zhejiang University(grant numbers:2021FZZX003-02-17); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9536755","Multimodal segmentation;graph attention;graph mutual information;MRI","Magnetic resonance imaging;Feature extraction;Lesions;Image segmentation;Liver;Fuses;Mutual information","biomedical MRI;convolutional neural nets;feature extraction;image enhancement;image segmentation;liver;medical image processing","bipartite graph;fully connected graphs;spatial-graph space;graph learning-based approach;graph convolution;global modality-specific features;multimodal magnetic resonance imaging segmentation;mutual information-based graph coattention networks;modality-specific learning strategy;deformation diagram;liver lesion;public prostate zone dataset;fusion process","","4","","69","IEEE","14 Sep 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This problem is important to city planners to evaluate and develop urban deployment plans. However, this task is challenging. Traditional traffic estimation approaches lack the ability to solve this problem, since no data about the impact can be collected before the deployment and old data fails to capture the traffic pattern changes. In this paper, we define the off-deployment traffic estimation problem as a traffic generation problem, and develop a novel deep generative model TrafficGAN that captures the shared patterns across spatial regions of how traffic conditions evolve according to travel demand changes and underlying road network structures. In particular, TrafficGAN captures the road network structures through a dynamic filter in the dynamic convolutional layer. We evaluate our TrafficGAN using a large-scale traffic data collected from Shenzhen, China. Results show that TrafficGAN can more accurately estimate the traffic conditions compared with all baselines.

To mitigate this problem and to improve classification for longer texts, researchers have sought to resolve the underlying causes of the computational cost and have proposed optimizations for the attention mechanism, which is the key element of every transformer model. In our study, we are not pursuing the ultimate goal of long text classification, i.e., the ability to analyze entire text instances at one time while preserving high performance at a reasonable computational cost. Instead, we propose a text truncation method called Text Guide, in which the original text length is reduced to a predefined limit in a manner that improves performance over naive and semi-naive approaches while preserving low computational costs. Text Guide benefits from the concept of feature importance, a notion from the explainable artificial intelligence domain. We demonstrate that Text Guide can be used to improve the performance of recent language models specifically designed for long text classification, such as Longformer. Moreover, we discovered that parameter optimization is the key to Text Guide performance and must be conducted before the method is deployed.

Recent works adopt the episodic training strategy to mimic the expected situation at testing time. However, these existing approaches simulate the test conditions too strictly during the training process, and thus cannot make full use of the given label information. Besides, these approaches mainly focus on the foreground-background target class segmentation setting. They only utilize binary mask labels for training. In this paper, we propose to leverage the multi-class label information during the episodic training. It will encourage the network to generate more semantically meaningful features for each category. After integrating the target class cues into the query features, we then propose a pyramid feature fusion module to mine the fused features for the final classifier. Furthermore, to take more advantage of the support image-mask pair, we propose a self-prototype guidance branch to support image segmentation. It can constrain the network for generating more compact features and a robust prototype for each semantic class. For inference, we propose a fused prototype guidance branch for the segmentation of the query image. Specifically, we leverage the prediction of the query image to extract the pseudo-prototype and combine it with the initial prototype.

Efficient QoS-aware service composition has been a challenging task in cloud computing. This challenge becomes more formidable in emerging resource-constrained computing paradigms, such as the Internet of Things and Fog. Service composition has regarded as a multi-objective combinatorial optimization problem that falls in the category of NP-hard. Historically, the proliferation of services added to problem complexity and navigated solutions from exact (none-heuristics) approaches to near-optimal heuristics and metaheuristics. Although metaheuristics have fulfilled some expectations, the quest for finding a high-quality, near-optimal solution has led researchers to devise hybrid methods. As a result, research on service composition shifts towards the hybridization of metaheuristics. Hybrid metaheuristics have been promising efforts to transcend the boundaries of metaheuristics by leveraging the strength of complementary methods to overcome base algorithm shortcomings. Despite the significance and frontier position of hybrid metaheuristics, to the best of our knowledge, there is no systematic research and survey in this field with a particular focus on strategies to hybridize traditional metaheuristics. This study’s core contribution is to infer a framework for hybridization strategies by conducting a mapping study that analyses 71 papers between 2008 and 2020.

In order to realize the large-scale promotion of SAS detection, the SAS detection method based on wearable devices has attracted the attention of some researchers. However, in view of the poor signals collected by wearable devices and the less variation between signals of different classes (normal/SAS), the detection methods in past studies are often unsatisfactory. In this study, a wearable SAS detection method based on 1-D multitask multiattention residual shrinkage convolution neural network (1D-MMResSNet) model and cost-sensitive (CS) classifier was proposed. First, the photoplethysmography (PPG) sleep data of 92 subjects were collected by using wearable smart Bracelet devices. Second, a backbone network composed of the residual multiattention mechanism convolution block and residual shrinkage convolution block was proposed to realize feature selection and feature extraction for pulse rate variability signals.

However, it is still a challenging task to achieve building extraction with high accuracy and integrity due to diverse building appearances and more complex ground background in VHR remote sensing images. Recently, unity networking (UNet) has been proven to be capable of feature extraction and semantic segmentation of remote sensing images. However, UNet cannot achieve sufficient multiscale and multilevel features with larger receptive fields. To address these problems, an improved network based on UNet structure (Refine-UNet) is proposed for extracting buildings from the VHR images. The proposed Refine-UNet mainly consists of an encoder module, a decoder module, and a refine skip connection scheme. The refine skip connection scheme is composed of an atrous spatial convolutional pyramid pooling (ASPP) module and several improved depthwise separable convolution (IDSC) modules. Experimental results on the Jilin-1 VHR datasets with a spatial resolution of 0.75 m demonstrate that compared with UNet, pyramid scene parsing network (PSPNet), DeepLabV3+, and a deep convolutional encoder-decoder architecture for image segmentation (SegNet), the proposed Refine-UNet can obtain more accurate building extraction results and achieve the best precision of 95.1% and intersection over union (IoU) of 87.0%, indicating the great practical potential.","1558-0571","","10.1109/LGRS.2023.3243609","Project of Jilin Province Development and Reform Commission(grant numbers:2021C044-7); Technological Research and Development Projects of Jilin(grant numbers:20220201017GX); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10041175","Atrous convolution;building extraction;unity networking (UNet);very high-resolution (VHR) remote sensing imagery","Buildings;Feature extraction;Convolution;Remote sensing;Decoding;Data mining;Spatial resolution","convolutional neural nets;deep learning (artificial intelligence);feature extraction;geophysical image processing;image classification;image resolution;image segmentation;object detection;remote sensing","accurate building extraction results;atrous spatial convolutional pyramid pooling module;diverse building appearances;extracting buildings;feature extraction;high-resolution remote sensing images;image segmentation;improved depthwise separable convolution modules;Jilin-1 VHR datasets;multilevel features;pyramid scene parsing network;refine skip connection scheme;Refine-UNet;size 0.75 m;sufficient multiscale features;UNet scene parsing network;UNet structure;VHR images;VHR remote sensing images","","","","18","IEEE","9 Feb 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this article, we present Plasticity-on-Chip (PoC) by engineering plasticity into ”artificial brains” to mine and exploit the self-similarity of HLPs. First, we present a communication modeling of HLPs (e.g., C/C++ implementations of various applications) that relies on static and dynamic compiler analysis of programs with varying input seeds, performing comprehensive program analysis of all traces, and representing the HLPs as weighted directed acyclic graphs while capturing the intrinsic timing constraints and data/control flow requirements. Second, we propose a rigorous mathematical framework for determining the optimal parallel degree of executing a set of interacting HLPs (by partitioning them into clusters of densely interconnected supernodes - tasks) which helps us decide the number of available heterogeneous PEs, the amount of required memory and the structure of the synthesized deadlock-free irregular NoC topology that offers an efficient communication medium. These clusters serve as abstract models of computation for the synthesized PEs within the parallel execution model. Finally, exploiting the fractal and complex networks concepts, we extract in-depth features from graphs that serve as inputs for distributed reinforcement learning.

Prediction of movies can be improved by using the characteristics of social web content about a movie such as social-quality, tag quality, and a temporal aspect. In this paper, we have proposed to utilize several features of social quality, user reputation and temporal features to predict popular or highly rated movies. Moreover, enhanced optimization-based voting classifier is proposed to improve the performance on proposed features. Voting classifier uses the knowledge of all the candidate classifiers but ignores the performance of the model on different classes. In the proposed model, weight is assigned to each model based on its performance for each class. For the optimal selection of weights for the candidate classifiers, Genetic Algorithm is used and the proposed model is called Genetic Algorithm Voting (GA-V) classifier. After labeling the suggested features by using a fixed threshold, several classifiers like Bayesian logistic regression, Naïve Bayes, BayesNet, Random Forest, SVM, Decision Tree, LSTM and AdaboostM1 are trained on MovieLens dataset to find high-quality/popular movies in different categories.

However, existing RGB-based scene comprehension methods may achieve unsatisfied performance when dealing with complex scenarios, insufficient illumination or occluded appearances. To solve this problem, by cooperating visual and thermal images, the Dual-Space Graph-based Interaction Network (DSGBINet) is proposed to achieve all-day time semantic segmentation of power equipment in high-voltage power transmission line and electric transformer substation scenes. Specifically, modality-specific features are first extracted via two separate backbone networks with the same architecture. Multi-modality high-level features are first fused via long-range relationship in coordinate space. Then, multi-modality features from regular grids are further clustered and assigned to vertices in feature space. Cross-graph and inner-graph regional relations are utilized for reasoning and enhancement, which could exploit the mutual benefits and extract rich contextual information in a semantic view. Furthermore, to overcome the huge scale difference and the inherent characteristic of thermal images, the idea of multi-task learning is integrated into the decoding process. The edge detection and semantic segmentation are achieved collaboratively, which could segment the different power equipment more accurately and completely. The comparative and ablation experiments on the proposed two RGB-T semantic segmentation datasets evaluate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed network compared with existing state-of-the-art methods.

Due to the lack of labeled data especially in the pixelwise task, it is urgent to develop unsupervised techniques to effectively detect changes. In this article, we propose a novel unsupervised representation learning framework for CD in SAR images, called multiscale self-attention (SA) deep clustering based on octave convolution. The main motivation is that a convolutional neural network (CNN) has the ability to extract significant feature hidden in input images, but it relies heavily on annotated data. Clustering is typically free from supervision; however, SAR images always suffer from speckle noise, which is unfriendly for clustering. Thus, we integrate unsupervised clustering with CNN to learn clustering-friendly feature representations. In the unified framework, CNN feature learning and clustering can be optimized end-to-end without supervision. To better suppress speckle noise and boost the joint optimization for distinguishing changes and unchanges, we use the K-means++ algorithm that is robust to noise as the clustering algorithm. In the meanwhile, we introduce the octave convolution and SA mechanism into the network to fully mine important spatial structure information for enhancing noise resistance of the network. Moreover, multiscale fusion modules are proposed to fuse multiscale input into a complementary feature representation that contains more context and semantic information around each pixel so that it refines the difference feature extraction while reducing speckle noise. Experiments on challenging SAR data sets demonstrate the effectiveness and potential of the proposed model compared with the current state-of-the-art algorithms.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2021.3073562","Key Scientific Technological Innovation Research Project by the Ministry of Education; State Key Program of National Natural Science of China(grant numbers:61836009); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:U1701267,61871310); Fund for Foreign Scholars in University Research and Teaching Programs (the 111 Project)(grant numbers:B07048); Major Research Plan of the National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:91438201); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9420689","Change detection (CD);deep clustering;multiscale fusion;octave convolution;self-attention (SA) mechanism;synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images","Feature extraction;Radar polarimetry;Speckle;Synthetic aperture radar;Convolution;Clustering algorithms;Pipelines","convolutional neural nets;feature extraction;geophysical image processing;image classification;image representation;image segmentation;object detection;pattern clustering;radar imaging;remote sensing by radar;speckle;synthetic aperture radar;unsupervised learning","SAR images;synthetic aperture radar image change detection;unsupervised techniques;unsupervised representation learning framework;octave convolution;convolutional neural network;significant feature;input images;annotated data;unsupervised clustering;clustering-friendly feature representations;CNN feature learning;speckle noise suppression;clustering algorithm;multiscale fusion modules;multiscale input;complementary feature representation;difference feature extraction;SAR data sets;multiscale self-attention deep clustering","","9","","51","IEEE","3 May 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Joint learning of knowledge in different graphs is an effective means to uncover the intrinsic structure of samples. However, the existing methods fail to simultaneously mine the global and local information related to sample structure and distribution when multiple graphs are available, and further research is needed. Hence, we propose a novel intrinsic graph learning (IGL) with discrete constrained diffusion–fusion to solve the above problem in this article. In detail, given a set of the predefined graphs, IGL first obtains the graph encoding the global high-order manifold structure via the diffusion–fusion mechanism based on the tensor product graph. Then, two discrete operators are integrated to fine-prune the obtained graph. One of them limits the maximum number of neighbors connected to each sample, thereby removing redundant and erroneous edges. The other one forces the rank of the Laplacian matrix of the obtained graph to be equal to the number of sample clusters, which guarantees that samples from the same subgraph belong to the same cluster and vice versa. Moreover, a new strategy of weight learning is designed to accurately quantify the contribution of pairwise predefined graphs in the optimization process.

Here, we focus on structure-borne noise, i.e., noise from vibrating mechanical parts. Detecting problematic noise sources early in the design and production process is essential for reducing a product's development costs and its time to market. In a close collaboration of visualization and automotive engineering, we designed a new, interactive approach to quickly identify and analyze critical noise sources, also contributing to an improved understanding of the analyzed system. Several carefully designed, interactive linked views enable the exploration of noises, vibrations, and harshness at multiple levels of detail, both in the frequency and spatial domain. This enables swift and smooth changes of perspective; selections in the frequency domain are immediately reflected in the spatial domain, and vice versa.

The reliable detection of single multi-digit values from natural imagery has been widely studied through the last decade (e.g. Street View House Numbers [SVHN]); however, extraction and assignment of the contextual meaning of those values are far more difficult given the diversity and unstructured nature of advertisements. To operationalize information extracted from detected values in the wild, the contextual meaning that those values represent is critical. To our knowledge, no large-scale visual dataset comprising multi-digit, multi-number values with associated context labels exists; we denote this class of problems as “multi-metric extraction in the wild”. In this work, we focus on the accurate detection and reading of gas prices, and their contextual association to gas grade and payment type. We provide complete annotations for the Gas Prices of America (GPA) dataset, comprising 2,048 training and 512 test images sampled across the United States including over 2,600 signs, 6,000 prices, 27,000 digits, and 7,800 gas grade and payment type labels. With these data, we develop the GasBotty predictor, a composite neural network model, and evaluate it over eight benchmark tasks of increasing difficulty. Finally, we define a new highly stringent, binary-type metric, denoted “All-or-Nothing Accuracy” (ANA), requiring that a predictor perfectly extract and correctly associate all information in a gas sign. Our proposed model achieves 72.9% ANA over the independent test set of 512 images, where conventional state-of-the-art models object detection models and both a uniform random and biased random predictor would all tend towards 0% ANA. GasBotty and the GPA dataset will serve as a valuable benchmark for the development of future multi-metric extraction in the wild systems.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3156578","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9727170","Multi-metric extraction;machine vision;optical character recognition","Data mining;Predictive models;Measurement;Annotations;Visualization;Benchmark testing;Transforms","advertising;neural nets;object detection","GasBotty;reliable detection;single multidigit values;natural imagery;street view house numbers;detected values;multinumber values;gas prices;contextual association;highly stringent type metric;binary-type metric;gas sign;wild systems;commodity advertisement;large-scale visual dataset;context labels;gas grade;payment type labels;multimetric extraction;ANA;all-or-nothing accuracy;composite neural network model","","1","","32","CCBY","3 Mar 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, most of the existing works are based on conventional techniques, which are not sufficient to get promising results. In this research work, we propose a hybrid Deep Learning-based model, namely Convolutional Neural Network concatenated with Long Short-Term Memory, to show the effectiveness of the proposed model for 8 important personality traits (Introversion-Extroversion, Intuition-Sensing, Thinking-Feeling, Judging-Perceiving). We implemented our experimental evaluations on the benchmark dataset to accomplish the personality trait classification task. Evaluations of the datasets have shown better results, which demonstrates that the proposed model can effectively classify the user’s personality traits as compared to the state-of-the-art techniques. Finally, we evaluate the effectiveness of our approach through statistical analysis. With the knowledge obtained from this research, organizations are capable of making their decisions regarding the recruitment of personals in an efficient way. Moreover, they can implement the information obtained from this research as best practices for the selection, management, and optimization of their policies, services, and products.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3121791","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9583245","Personality trait;deep learning;artificial intelligence;convolutional neural network;long short-term memory;social networks;machine learning","Social networking (online);Deep learning;Feature extraction;Convolutional neural networks;Machine learning;Blogs;Data mining","behavioural sciences computing;cognition;convolutional neural nets;deep learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;psychology;recurrent neural nets;statistical analysis;text analysis","personality trait classification;statistical analysis;hybrid deep learning;convolutional neural network;long short-term memory","","16","","65","CCBY","21 Oct 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, collecting abundant security patches from diverse data sources is not a simple task. This is because (1) each data source provides vulnerability information in a different way and (2) many security patches cannot be directly collected from Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) information (e. g., National Vulnerability Database (NVD) references). In this paper, we propose a high-coverage approach that collects known security patches by tracking multiple data sources. Specifically, we considered the following three data sources: repositories (e. g., GitHub), issue trackers (e. g., Bugzilla), and Q&A sites (e. g., Stack Overflow). From the data sources, we gather even security patches that cannot be collected by considering only CVE information (i. e., previously untracked security patches). In our experiments, we collected 12,432 CVE patches from repositories and issue trackers, and 12,458 insecure posts from Q&A sites. We could collect at least four times more CVE patches than those collected in existing approaches, which demonstrates the efficacy of our approach. The collected security patches serves as a database on a public website (i. e., IoTcube) to proceed with the detection of vulnerable code clones.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3197786","Institute of Information and Communications Technology Planning and Evaluation (IITP); Korea Government (Development of Automated Vulnerability Discovery Technologies for Blockchain Platform Security)(grant numbers:2019-0-01697); (Development of Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) Technologies for Securing Software Supply Chains)(grant numbers:2022-0-00277); (Convergence Security Core Talent Training Business)(grant numbers:2022-0-01198); (ICT Creative Consilience Program)(grant numbers:IITP-2022-2020-0-01819); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9853545","Open source software;software security;vulnerability database","Security;Databases;Soft sensors;Codes;Software development management;Supply chains;Open source software","database management systems;public domain software;security of data;Web sites","high-coverage approach;one-day vulnerabilities;abundant security patches;diverse data sources;vulnerability information;National Vulnerability Database;multiple data sources;CVE patches;common vulnerabilities and exposures information;public Website","","","","27","CCBY","10 Aug 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Inappropriate decisions may lead to severe consequences for companies. Considering that the evaluation of alternatives is generally affected by several criteria, decision-making should be considered a very challenging task. From the 1945s to the present day, various multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) methods have evolved, supporting people in the decision-making process. The main aim of this paper is to propose an original MCDM method and to demonstrate its applicability in an empirical case study that relates to the Electric Vehicle (EV) selection problem. To solve the electric vehicle selection problem for the last-mile delivery, we developed and applied a new MCDM method - the AROMAN (Alternative Ranking Order Method Accounting for Two-Step Normalization) method. The main contribution of the AROMAN method is coupling the linear and vector normalization techniques to obtain precise data structures used in further calculation. In addition, the original final ranking equation is developed. To demonstrate the robustness of the proposed method, a comparative analysis with other state-of-the-art MCDM methods is conducted. The results indicate a high level of confidence in the AROMAN method in the decision-making field. In addition, the sensitivity analysis is performed, and the results indicate a high level of stability. Nevertheless, based on the confident results, the managerial implications have also been indicated.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3265818","Project “Sustainable Urban Mobility Plans, E-Commerce, and Smart City Logistics”(grant numbers:CK01000032); Research Program(grant numbers:SGS_2023_017); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10097712","Multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM);normalization;electric vehicles;last-mile delivery;alternative ranking order method accounting for two-step normalization (AROMAN)","Decision making;Electric vehicles;Transportation;Robustness;Logistics;Sustainable development;Batteries","decision making;electric vehicles;fuzzy set theory;operations research;sensitivity analysis;transportation","alternative ranking order method accounting for two-step normalization;AROMAN method;electric vehicle selection problem;multicriteria decision-making methods;original MCDM method","","1","","52","CCBYNCND","10 Apr 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A fast and efficient build process is crucial to provide timely CI feedback to developers. If CI feedback is too slow, developers may switch contexts to other tasks, which is known to be a costly operation for knowledge workers. Thus, minimizing the build execution time for CI services is an important task. While recent work has made several important advances in the acceleration of CI builds, optimizations often depend upon explicitly defined build dependency graphs (e.g., make, Gradle, CloudBuild, Bazel). These hand-maintained graphs may be (a) underspecified, leading to incorrect build behaviour; or (b) overspecified, leading to missed acceleration opportunities. In this paper, we propose Kotinos—a language-agnostic approach to infer data from which build acceleration decisions can be made without relying upon build specifications. After inferring this data, our approach accelerates CI builds by caching the build environment and skipping unaffected build steps. Kotinos is at the core of a commercial CI service with a growing customer base. To evaluate Kotinos, we mine 14,364 historical CI build records spanning three proprietary and seven open-source software projects. We find that: (1) at least 87.9 percent of the builds activate at least one Kotinos acceleration; and (2) 74 percent of accelerated builds achieve a speed-up of two-fold with respect to their non-accelerated counterparts. Moreover, (3) the benefits of Kotinos can also be replicated in open source software systems; and (4) Kotinos imposes minimal resource overhead (i.e., $<$< 1 percent median CPU usage, 2 MB – 2.2 GB median memory usage, and 0.4 GB – 5.2 GB median storage overhead) and does not compromise build outcomes. Our results suggest that migration to Kotinos yields substantial benefits with minimal investment of effort (e.g., no migration of build systems is necessary).","1939-3520","","10.1109/TSE.2020.3048335","Mitacs(grant numbers:IT13813); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9311876","Automated builds;build systems;continuous integration","Acceleration;Software;Tools;Statistics;Sociology;Organizations;Testing","cache storage;graph theory;project management;public domain software;security of data;software development management;software libraries;software maintenance;software quality","continuous integration;caching environments;software development organizations;CI services;dependency graphs;hand-maintained graphs;commercial CI service;Kotinos acceleration;open source software systems;open-source software projects;historical CI;Kotinos approach;CI feedback;memory size 0.4 GByte to 5.2 GByte;efficiency 87.9 percent;efficiency 74.0 percent;efficiency 1.0 percent;memory size 2.0 MByte to 2.2 GByte","","2","","51","IEEE","31 Dec 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
